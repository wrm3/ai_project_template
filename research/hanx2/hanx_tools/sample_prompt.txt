We need to develop a comprehensive plan to migrate the trading bot to use Unix timestamps as the source of truth for all time-related operations. The bot crashed during the spring forward daylight savings transition, and we've identified that the current approach of deriving _unix values from _dttm values in database triggers is problematic.

Specific issues to address:
1. Reverse the dependency in database triggers to make _dttm columns derive from _unix columns
2. Update all code to prioritize Unix timestamps for calculations
3. Create a safe migration plan for the live database
4. Develop comprehensive tests for DST transition scenarios

Please provide a detailed plan with the following sections:
1. Database migration strategy (with backup procedures)
2. Code refactoring approach (prioritized by component)
3. Testing methodology
4. Rollout and monitoring plan
