```

## Context Requirements

### Minimum Context Needed
- **Fundraising stage**: Pre-seed, seed, Series A, B, C+
- **Company profile**: Industry, business model, current traction
- **Ask**: Amount raising, current valuation (if applicable)

### Optimal Context
- Current metrics (ARR, customers, growth rate)
- Previous fundraising history
- Team composition and background
- Product status and roadmap
- Target use of funds
- Geographic location

### Context Gathering
If insufficient context, agent should ask:
1. "What stage are you at?" (pre-seed, seed, Series A, etc.)
2. "What are your current metrics?" (revenue, customers, growth)
3. "How much are you looking to raise?"
4. "What's your industry/business model?"
5. "Where are you located?" (for VC geography targeting)

## Stage-Specific Rules

### Pre-Seed ($50k-$500k)
- Focus on problem validation and team
- Expect limited traction metrics
- Emphasize founder background and domain expertise
- Target angels, pre-seed funds, incubators
- Accept that projections are speculative

### Seed ($500k-$3M)
- Require product-market fit signals
- Expect $10k-$100k MRR or equivalent traction
- Focus on growth rate (15-30% MoM)
- Target seed VCs and angel groups
- Use realistic 3-year projections

### Series A ($3M-$15M)
- Require $1M+ ARR and strong growth (100%+ YoY)
- Expect proven unit economics (LTV/CAC > 3x)
- Focus on scalable go-to-market
- Target institutional VCs (Series A focused)
- Show path to $10M+ ARR

### Series B+ ($15M+)
- Require $10M+ ARR and efficient growth
- Expect category leadership positioning
- Focus on market expansion opportunities
- Target growth-stage VCs and crossover funds
- Show path to profitability and IPO

### Red Flags to Highlight
**Pitch Deck**:
- Unrealistic projections (10x+ growth with no basis)
- Missing traction or metrics
- Weak or incomplete team
- Unclear competitive differentiation
- Vague use of funds

**Term Sheet**:
- Participating preferred stock
- Multiple liquidation preference (2x+)
- Full ratchet anti-dilution
- Excessive board control for investors
- Unreasonable no-shop period (> 60 days)
- Unusual closing conditions

### Benchmarking
Always compare against:
- Industry-standard metrics for stage
- Typical valuation multiples
- Market-standard term sheet terms
- Fundraising timeline expectations
- Dilution ranges by stage

## Best Practices Enforcement

### Fundraising Process
- ✅ Start with 6-9 months runway
- ✅ Build VC list of 100+ firms
- ✅ Pursue warm intros (highest success rate)
- ✅ Batch meetings (2-3 week sprints)
- ✅ Follow up within 24 hours
- ✅ Keep multiple processes parallel (not sequential)
- ✅ Target 3-6 month timeline (don't let drag)

### Pitch Deck
- ✅ 15 slides maximum (main deck)
- ✅ Problem-first, not solution-first
- ✅ Quantify everything (metrics, market, impact)
- ✅ Show traction (not just potential)
- ✅ Current data (< 1 month old)
- ✅ Professional design (clean, readable)
- ✅ Backup slides (appendix) for detailed Q&A

### Term Negotiation
- ✅ Consult startup lawyer always
- ✅ Get multiple term sheets (leverage)
- ✅ Prioritize: partnership > terms > valuation
- ✅ Push for 1x non-participating liquidation preference
- ✅ Ensure broad-based weighted average anti-dilution
- ✅ Limit protective provisions to major events
- ✅ 30-day no-shop period (45 max)

### Due Diligence
- ✅ Organize data room in advance
- ✅ Respond to requests within 24-48 hours
- ✅ Be transparent about challenges
- ✅ Prepare 3-5 customer references
- ✅ Weekly status updates to VC
- ✅ Maintain momentum and urgency

## Error Handling

### Common User Errors

**Insufficient Context**:
- User: "Review my pitch deck"
- Response: Ask for deck file, stage, and current metrics

**Stage Mismatch**:
- User has $0 revenue but wants Series A guidance
- Response: Redirect to appropriate stage (pre-seed or seed)

**Unrealistic Expectations**:
- User expects to raise $10M seed with no traction
- Response: Calibrate expectations with stage-appropriate metrics

**Missing Key Information**:
- User asks for VC list but doesn't specify stage, industry, or geography
- Response: Gather requirements before researching

### Fallback Strategies

**If skill resources unavailable**:
- Provide general best practices from rules.md
- Reference external resources (Y Combinator, First Round)
- Suggest consulting with experienced founders or advisors

**If agent (Opus) unavailable**:
- Provide structured guidance from SKILL.md
- Use reference guides for stage-specific advice
- Recommend manual analysis with provided frameworks

**If user needs exceed skill scope**:
- Recommend consulting professional advisors (lawyers, bankers)
- Suggest founder communities (YC, On Deck, SaaStr)
- Reference additional learning resources

## Maintenance and Updates

### Update Frequency
- **VC Database**: Quarterly (market changes frequently)
- **Metrics Benchmarks**: Semi-annually (industry standards evolve)
- **Term Sheet Standards**: Annually (market practices change slowly)
- **Templates**: As needed (based on user feedback)

### Version Control

- Document changes in changelog
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Archive old reference materials

### Quality Metrics
- User satisfaction with guidance
- Fundraising success rate (if trackable)
- Pitch deck quality improvements

## Privacy and Confidentiality

### Sensitive Information Handling
- **Pitch decks**: Treat as confidential, don't share externally
- **Financials**: Handle with care, don't expose in logs
- **Term sheets**: Highly confidential, analyze privately
- **Cap tables**: Sensitive ownership data, protect carefully
- **VC conversations**: Private communications, don't disclose

### Data Security

- Recommend secure data rooms (DocSend, Dropbox)

### Legal Disclaimers
