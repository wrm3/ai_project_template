2. **NDAs**: Have manufacturer sign before sharing details
3. **Trademarks**: Register in manufacturing country
4. **Split production**: Use multiple manufacturers for key components
5. **Keep key processes in-house**: Don't outsource core IP
6. **Legal contracts**: Clear IP ownership terms
7. **Monitor market**: Watch for copycats

**China-Specific**:
- File patents in China (not just US)
- Use reputable manufacturers (less likely to steal IP)
- Visit factories to ensure no side production
- Build strong relationships
- Accept some risk (cost of doing business)

## University Resources

### Technology Transfer Offices

**Overview**:
- Universities commercialize faculty research through tech transfer
- Startups can license IP developed at universities
- Often faculty-founded startups or spinouts

**How It Works**:
1. Faculty/researcher develops technology
2. University files patent
3. University owns IP (Bayh-Dole Act)
4. Startup licenses IP from university
5. University gets equity and/or royalties

**Typical Deal Terms**:
- Upfront fee: $0-$25,000
- Equity: 2-5% (sometimes more)
- Royalties: 2-6% of revenue (with minimums)
- Milestones: Funding, development, revenue
- Sponsored research: Often required ($50k-$500k)

**Top Universities for Tech Transfer**:
1. **MIT**: Strong engineering, biology, AI/ML
2. **Stanford**: Computer science, biology, medical devices
3. **UC Berkeley**: Chemistry, materials, semiconductors

- Sponsored research requirements
- University bureaucracy
- Potential conflicts with faculty inventor

**Best Practices**:
- Negotiate BEFORE raising VC (simpler terms)
- Get exclusive license (if possible)

- Applying to only one provider (get all three)

**Lab Space**:
- Signing long-term lease too early (stay flexible)
- Buying equipment you can share/rent (massive capital waste)
- Underestimating space needs (plan for 2x growth)
- Choosing cheapest option (quality and location matter)

**Manufacturing**:
- Choosing manufacturer based only on price (quality matters more)
- Not ordering samples (must test before committing)
- Skipping factory visits (for large orders, always visit)
- Weak IP protection (NDAs, patents before disclosing)
- No backup manufacturer (single point of failure)

**Grants**:
- Applying to wrong agency/program (read solicitations carefully)
- Weak commercialization plan (agencies want impact)
- Underestimating time required (budget 100+ hours)
- Giving up after one rejection (resubmit with improvements)
- Not talking to program officers (they can help)

**Accelerators**:
- Applying too early (no traction) or too late (don't need it)
- Not researching fit (wasting time on bad matches)
- Weak application (spend time, get feedback)
- Only applying to one (apply to 5-10 to increase odds)

## Conclusion

Accessing the right resources at the right time can mean the difference between success and failure for startups. By strategically leveraging:

- **Cloud credits** ($350k+ from AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Lab space** (saves $10k-$30k/month vs. dedicated facilities)
- **Manufacturing partners** (saves 50-70% vs. domestic-only)
- **Grant programs** ($1M-$2M+ in non-dilutive funding)
- **Accelerators** ($120k-$500k + networks and credibility)
- **University resources** (expertise, facilities, talent)

...startups can extend runway by 12-24+ months, reduce dilution by 10-20%, and accelerate time to market by 6-12 months.

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Start early**: Apply for resources as soon as eligible
2. **Stack resources**: Combine multiple programs for maximum benefit
3. **Non-dilutive first**: Grants and credits before raising equity
4. **Share, don't own**: Use shared facilities and equipment early
5. **Strategic sequencing**: Bootstrap → shared resources → dedicated facilities
6. **Quality matters**: Cheap isn't always better (manufacturing, lab space)
7. **Network**: Resources come through relationships
8. **Be patient**: Grants take 6-12 months (plan accordingly)

The startup resource landscape has never been better. Take advantage of the billions of dollars in programs designed specifically to help you succeed.
