## Cost Comparison Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Early Biotech (Pre-Seed)

**Option A: Shared Lab (BioLabs)**
- Bench space: $2,500/month
- Equipment included: $0
- Core facilities: $500/month
- **Total**: $3,000/month ($36k/year)

**Option B: Build Own Lab**

- Build-out: $100k amortized ($2,000/month)
- Equipment: $50k amortized ($1,000/month)
- Maintenance: $500/month
- Utilities: $300/month
- **Total**: $6,800/month ($82k/year)

**Savings with shared lab**: $46k/year (56% cheaper)

### Scenario 2: Hardware Startup (Seed Stage)

**Option A: Dry Lab Space + Makerspace**
- Desk at lab space: $800/month
- Makerspace membership: $150/month
- Equipment rental: $200/month
- **Total**: $1,150/month ($14k/year)

**Option B: Own Workshop**

   - Cultural fit with community

5. **Warm Intros**:
   - Network with portfolio companies
   - Get introductions from investors
   - Attend program events
   - Connect with alumni

### Application Timeline

**3 Months Before Need**:

- Visit facilities
- Talk to current members
- Gather application materials

**2 Months Before**:
- Submit applications (multiple programs)
- Prepare pitch deck
- Line up references
- Organize financial documents

**1 Month Before**:
- Interview with programs
- Negotiate terms
- Compare offers
- Make decision

**Move-In**:
- Coordinate logistics
- Order initial supplies
- Set up equipment
- Meet community

### Multiple Applications

**Apply to 3-5 programs simultaneously**:
- Increases odds of acceptance
- Provides negotiating leverage
- Allows comparison
- Backup options if rejected

**Prioritize by**:
1. Location (where is your team?)
2. Cost (can you afford it?)
3. Fit (does the community match?)
4. Resources (equipment, mentorship)
5. Flexibility (terms, expansion)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Application Phase**:
- Applying too early (no funding, no team)
- Applying too late (need space immediately)
- Only applying to one program
- Not visiting in person (if possible)
- Weak financials or business plan

**Usage Phase**:
- Not utilizing shared equipment (paying for bench, not using resources)
- Hoarding bench space (not optimizing use)
- Poor community citizenship (not networking, not sharing)
- Violating safety rules (can get kicked out)
- Not budgeting for equipment fees

**Growth Phase**:
- Staying too long (cheaper to move to dedicated space at scale)
- Moving too early (unnecessary expense)
- Not planning for expansion (sudden space needs)
