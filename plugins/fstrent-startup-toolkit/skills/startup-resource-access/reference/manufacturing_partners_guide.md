- Pressure for large upfront payment
- Vague on quality control
- Prices too good to be true
- Poor communication

### Sample Order Process

1. Request samples ($50-$500)
2. Test quality thoroughly
3. Identify issues
4. Iterate on design
5. Place pilot order (500-1,000 units)
6. Inspect pilot run
7. Scale to full production

## Quality Control

### Inspection Points

1. **Pre-production**: Review materials and setup
2. **During production**: Check at 20-50% completion
3. **Final inspection**: Before shipping (AQL sampling)
4. **Receiving inspection**: When product arrives

### Third-Party Inspection Companies

- **SGS**: $300-$500 per inspection
- **Bureau Veritas**: European standard
- **Intertek**: Electronics focus
- **QIMA**: Tech-enabled inspections

### AQL Standards

- AQL 2.5: General consumer products
- AQL 1.0: Higher quality requirements
- AQL 0.65: Critical products

**Budget**: 2-5% of order value for QC

## IP Protection

**Strategies**:
1. File patents before disclosure
2. Sign NDAs with manufacturers
3. Register trademarks in manufacturing country
4. Split production (multiple manufacturers)
5. Keep key processes in-house
6. Clear IP ownership in contracts
7. Monitor market for copycats

**China-Specific**:
- File patents in China (not just US)
- Use reputable manufacturers
- Visit factories regularly
- Build strong relationships

## Cost Optimization

**Negotiation Tips**:
- Get quotes from 5+ manufacturers
- Negotiate MOQs (start lower, commit to growth)
- Annual volume commitments (for better pricing)
- Payment terms (30/70 split vs. 50/50)
- Shipping (FOB vs. DDP)

**Tooling Costs**:
- Simple parts: $2,000-$10,000
