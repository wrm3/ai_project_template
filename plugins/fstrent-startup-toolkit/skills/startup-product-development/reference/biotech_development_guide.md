# Biotech/Pharma Development Guide
> R&D to FDA approval for diagnostics, devices, and therapeutics

## Development Phases
### Discovery (Year 1)
- Literature review, hypothesis generation
- Target identification
- Assay development
- Proof of concept data

### Preclinical (Year 1-2)
- In vitro validation
- Animal studies (if therapeutic)
- Safety/toxicity testing
- Manufacturing process development

### Clinical Trials (Year 2-4)
- Phase I: Safety (20-80 patients)
- Phase II: Efficacy (100-300 patients)
- Phase III: Confirmation (1000+ patients)

### FDA Submission (Year 3-5)
- 510(k) for Class II devices (substantial equivalence)
- PMA for Class III devices (new/high risk)
- IND/NDA for therapeutics

### Manufacturing (Year 4-6)
- GMP facility qualification
- Process validation
- Quality systems (ISO 13485)

## Regulatory Pathways
### Medical Devices
**510(k) Clearance**: $5K-50K, 3-12 months
**De Novo**: $50K-200K, 12-18 months
**PMA**: $200K-500K+, 1-3 years

### Diagnostics
**CLIA Waiver**: Simplest, point-of-care tests
**Moderate Complexity**: Lab-based tests
**High Complexity**: Research use only → Clinical validation

### Therapeutics
**IND Application**: Investigational New Drug
**NDA/BLA**: New Drug Application / Biologics License
**Timeline**: 8-15 years, $500M-$2B+

## Clinical Trial Design
**Endpoints**: Primary (efficacy), Secondary (safety, QoL)
**Blinding**: Single-blind, double-blind, open-label
**Controls**: Placebo, active comparator, historical
**Statistical Power**: 80%+ power to detect effect

**Example**: Diagnostic test validation
- N=200-500 samples
- Compare to gold standard (PCR, culture)
- Sensitivity >90%, Specificity >95%
- Cost: $100K-500K

## IP Strategy
**Patent Claims**:
- Composition of matter
- Method of use
- Manufacturing process

**Timeline**:
- Provisional patent: Day 1 (establish priority)
- PCT filing: Within 12 months
- National phase: Within 30 months

**Budget**: $10K-30K for provisional, $30K-100K+ for utility patent
