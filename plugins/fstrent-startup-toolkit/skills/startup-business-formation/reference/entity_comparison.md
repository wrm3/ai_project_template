## Detailed Comparison

### Sole Proprietorship

**What It Is**: You are the business. No legal separation between you and business.

**Formation**:
- No filing required
- Use your SSN as tax ID (or get EIN)
- DBA filing if using business name different from your personal name

**Pros**:
- Simplest structure
- No formation costs
- Complete control
- Pass-through taxation (no separate business tax)
- Minimal compliance requirements

**Cons**:
- **Unlimited personal liability**: Your personal assets at risk for business debts
- No separation between personal and business
- Harder to raise funding
- No employee equity (can't issue stock)
- Ends when owner dies or quits

**Tax Treatment**:
- Business income/loss reported on personal return (Schedule C)
- All profit taxed as ordinary income
- Pay self-employment tax (15.3% on profits)
- No salary/distributions distinction

**Best For**:
- Solo consultants/freelancers
- Very small service businesses
- Testing business idea before committing to formal entity
- Businesses with minimal liability risk

**NOT For**:
- Anything with liability risk (product, employees, etc.)
- Businesses planning to raise funding
- Businesses planning to hire employees
- Anything you want to scale

**Annual Cost**: ~$0-500 (business licenses, DBA renewal)

**Example**: Freelance writer, independent consultant, side project

### Partnership

**What It Is**: Two or more people operate business together. Default structure for multi-owner businesses without formal entity.

**Types**:
- **General Partnership (GP)**: All partners have management rights and personal liability
- **Limited Partnership (LP)**: General partners (manage, liable) + Limited partners (invest only, not liable)
- **Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)**: All partners protected from other partners' malpractice (professional services)

**Formation**:
- GP: No filing required (created automatically when 2+ people operate business)
- LP/LLP: File with state

**Pros**:
- Simple to form (GP is automatic)
- Pass-through taxation
- Multiple owners can share control
- Partners can contribute different skills/resources

**Cons**:
- **Unlimited personal liability** (GP): Each partner personally liable for ALL business debts, including other partners' actions
- Partnership disputes common (50/50 deadlock)
- Ends if partner leaves (unless agreement provides otherwise)
- Can't issue stock (equity compensation difficult)
- Not suitable for VC funding

**Tax Treatment**:
- File Form 1065 (partnership return)
- Issue K-1 to each partner (reports share of income/loss)
- Partners report K-1 income on personal returns
- Pay self-employment tax on share of profits

**Best For**:
- Small professional services (law firm, accounting firm)
- Family businesses
- Multi-founder businesses in pre-incorporation phase

**NOT For**:
- High-growth startups (use C-Corp instead)
- Significant liability risk (use LLC or corporation)
- Businesses planning to raise VC funding

**Annual Cost**: ~$100-1,000 (depending on type, state fees, tax prep)

**Example**: Two consultants working together, family restaurant

**Recommendation**: If you have co-founders and plan to scale, skip partnership and form C-Corp immediately. Partnership is default structure while deciding, not long-term solution.

### Limited Liability Company (LLC)

**What It Is**: Hybrid entity with corporation's limited liability and partnership's tax flexibility.

**Formation**:
- File Articles of Organization with state
- Adopt Operating Agreement (internal document, not filed)
- Obtain EIN
- State filing fees: $100-800

**Pros**:
- **Limited liability**: Personal assets protected from business debts
- Flexible taxation (can elect pass-through or corporate)
- Flexible ownership structure (no stock restrictions)
- Simple management (less formality than corporation)
- Flexible profit distributions (don't need to match ownership %)
- Single-member LLC is simple (like sole proprietorship with liability protection)

**Cons**:
- **Can't raise VC funding**: Investors require C-Corp
- Can't issue stock options (more complex profits interests instead)
- Tax complexity with multiple members (K-1s)
- Less established legal framework than corporations
- Some states have high annual fees (California $800/year minimum)
- Self-employment tax on all profits (no salary/distribution split like S-Corp)

**Tax Treatment** (Default):
- Single-member: Disregarded entity (taxed like sole proprietorship)
- Multi-member: Taxed like partnership (Form 1065, K-1s)
- Can elect C-Corp or S-Corp taxation

**Tax Treatment** (Electing S-Corp):
- Pay yourself reasonable salary (subject to payroll tax)
- Remaining profits distributed as dividends (no payroll tax)
- Saves self-employment tax on dividend portion
- Requires payroll processing

**Best For**:
- Small businesses not raising VC funding
- Real estate investments
- Service businesses (consulting, agency, etc.)
- Businesses with 1-5 owners
- Businesses wanting tax flexibility

**NOT For**:
- Startups raising VC funding (VCs require C-Corp)
- Businesses planning to IPO
- Businesses wanting simple stock option plans

**Annual Cost**: $100-1,800 (state fees vary widely; CA is $800/year minimum)

**Example**: Small software agency, real estate holding company, local service business

**State Variations**:
- **California**: $800/year minimum franchise tax (even with $0 revenue)
- **Delaware**: $300/year tax, popular for LLCs like C-Corps
- **Wyoming/Nevada**: Low fees, business-friendly, privacy protections

**LLC vs C-Corp Decision**:
- **Choose LLC if**: Not raising VC funding, want tax flexibility, prefer simplicity
- **Choose C-Corp if**: Raising VC funding, want to IPO someday, want stock options

### S-Corporation

**What It Is**: C-Corporation that elects special tax treatment (pass-through taxation).

**Formation**:
- Form as C-Corp (file Certificate of Incorporation)
- File Form 2553 with IRS to elect S-Corp taxation
- Must meet strict requirements

**S-Corp Requirements**:
- Maximum 100 shareholders
- Only one class of stock (no preferred stock)
- Shareholders must be US citizens/residents
- Shareholders must be individuals (not VCs, not other corporations)
- Cannot have foreign ownership

**Pros**:
- **Limited liability**: Personal assets protected
- **Tax savings**: Pay salary (subject to payroll tax) + distributions (not subject to payroll tax)
- Avoid double taxation of C-Corp
- Corporate structure (stock, board, formal governance)

**Cons**:
- **Cannot raise VC funding**: VCs can't invest (not individuals, want preferred stock)
- Ownership restrictions (100 shareholders, US only, individuals only)
- No stock classes (can't issue preferred stock to investors)
- Complexity (payroll, reasonable salary determination, compliance)
- Shareholder basis tracking (for tax purposes)
- IRS scrutiny (salary vs distributions must be "reasonable")

**Tax Treatment**:
- File Form 1120-S (S-Corp return)
- Issue K-1 to each shareholder
- Shareholders report K-1 income on personal returns
- Pay salary subject to payroll taxes (Social Security, Medicare)
- Distributions not subject to payroll taxes

**Tax Savings Example**:
```
C-Corp (No Election):
- Profit: $100,000
- Self-employment tax (15.3%): $15,300
- Income tax: ~$24,000
- Total tax: ~$39,300

S-Corp (With Election):
- Profit: $100,000
- Salary: $60,000 (reasonable compensation)
- Payroll tax on salary: $9,180
- Distribution: $40,000 (no payroll tax)
- Income tax: ~$24,000
- Total tax: ~$33,180

Savings: ~$6,120/year
```

**Best For**:
- Profitable small businesses (tax savings worth complexity)
- Service businesses (consulting, professional services)
- Businesses with US-only owners
- Businesses NOT raising VC funding
- Businesses with significant profits ($50K+/year)

**NOT For**:
- Startups raising VC funding (use C-Corp instead)
- Businesses planning investor fundraising
- International founders or investors
- Early-stage startups (not yet profitable)

**Annual Cost**: $800-2,000 (state fees + payroll processing + tax prep)

**Common Mistake**: Startups elect S-Corp thinking it saves taxes, but:
- Early startups have no profit (no tax savings)
- S-Corp prevents VC fundraising
- Converting S-Corp to C-Corp later is complex
- Just start as C-Corp if planning to raise funding

**S-Corp Election Timing**:
- Must elect by March 15 of tax year (or within 75 days of formation)
- Late elections possible but complex

**Recommendation**: Only use S-Corp for established, profitable small businesses NOT raising VC funding. Do NOT use for startups.

### C-Corporation

**What It Is**: Traditional corporation. Default entity for VC-backed startups and public companies.

**Formation**:
- File Certificate of Incorporation with state (Delaware recommended)
- Adopt Bylaws
- Issue stock to founders
- Obtain EIN
- Hold organizational meeting

**Pros**:
- **VC Funding Compatible**: Required by all VC investors
- **Unlimited growth potential**: Can have unlimited shareholders, multiple stock classes
- **Stock options**: Easy to issue employee stock options
- **Limited liability**: Strong protection for shareholders
- **Perpetual existence**: Doesn't end when founders leave
- **Professional image**: Most established legal structure
- **QSBS benefits**: Qualified Small Business Stock tax benefits (exclude $10M+ in gains)
- **Clear legal framework**: Extensive case law, especially in Delaware

**Cons**:
- **Double taxation**: Corporation pays tax on profit, shareholders pay tax on dividends
- **Complexity**: More formalities (board meetings, minutes, resolutions)
- **Cost**: Higher formation and annual costs
- **Regulation**: More compliance requirements (Sarbanes-Oxley if public)

**Tax Treatment**:
- Corporation files Form 1120
- Corporate tax rate: 21% (federal)
- Dividends taxed at personal level: 15-20% (qualified dividends)
- Double taxation: ~36% effective (21% corp + 15% personal)

**But startups avoid double taxation**:
- Early startups don't make profit (reinvest everything)
- Don't pay dividends (retain earnings for growth)
- Exit via acquisition (capital gains, not dividends)
- QSBS exclusion reduces/eliminates capital gains tax

**Tax Example**:
```
Traditional Business (Pays Dividends):
- Corporate profit: $100,000
- Corporate tax (21%): $21,000
- After-tax: $79,000
- Distribute as dividend: $79,000
- Personal tax (15%): $11,850
- Net to owner: $67,150
- Effective rate: 32.85%

Startup (No Dividends):
- Corporate profit: $100,000
- Corporate tax: $21,000
- Reinvest in growth: $79,000
- Personal tax: $0 (no dividend)
- Total tax: $21,000
- Effective rate: 21%

Later exit via acquisition (QSBS qualified):
- Sell company for $100M
- Capital gains: $100M
- QSBS exclusion: $10M-100M excluded
- Tax on excluded portion: $0
- Massive tax savings vs. ordinary income
```

**Best For**:
- **Startups raising VC funding** (required, non-negotiable)
- High-growth businesses planning to scale quickly
- Businesses planning eventual IPO
- Businesses wanting to issue stock options to employees
- Businesses wanting maximum credibility and structure

**NOT For**:
- Lifestyle businesses (LLC is simpler)
- Businesses avoiding complexity
- Bootstrapped businesses staying small (LLC is better)

**Annual Cost**: $1,500-5,000 (Delaware fees, registered agent, tax prep, compliance)

**State Selection**:
- **Delaware**: Industry standard, required by VCs, best legal framework
- **Home state**: If bootstrapping and staying small
- **Wyoming/Nevada**: Sometimes used but VCs prefer Delaware

**Recommendation**:
- **Use C-Corp if**: Raising VC funding (or might someday), planning to scale quickly, want employee stock options
- **Use LLC if**: Bootstrapping forever, small team, don't want complexity

### Benefit Corporation (B-Corp)

**What It Is**: C-Corp with public benefit mission legally protected.

**Formation**:
- Form as C-Corp
- Include benefit purpose in Certificate of Incorporation
- Commit to social/environmental mission
- Obtain third-party certification (B Lab) (optional but common)

**Difference from C-Corp**:
- Directors must consider stakeholder impact (not just shareholders)
- Public benefit purpose stated in charter
- Must publish annual benefit report
- Can defend decisions that prioritize mission over profit

**Pros**:
- **Mission protection**: Legal right to prioritize social/environmental impact
- **Stakeholder consideration**: Can consider employees, community, environment in decisions
- **Credibility**: B-Corp certification signals commitment to values
- **Talent attraction**: Appeals to mission-driven employees
- **Customer loyalty**: Consumers increasingly support B-Corps
- All C-Corp benefits (VC funding, stock options, etc.)

**Cons**:
- **Complexity**: All C-Corp complexity + benefit reporting
- **Certification cost**: $1,000-50,000/year (based on revenue) for B Lab certification
- **Accountability**: Must publish benefit report (transparency requirement)
- **Potential conflicts**: Mission vs profit tensions
- Some investors skeptical (but most VCs okay with it now)

**Tax Treatment**:
- Same as C-Corp (no tax benefit)
- Double taxation applies
- QSBS eligible

**Best For**:
- Mission-driven startups (social enterprise, environmental, etc.)
- Consumer brands with values-based positioning
- Businesses where impact matters to customers
- Founders who want legal protection for mission

**NOT For**:
- Businesses where profit is only priority
- Founders not committed to impact reporting
- Situations where B-Corp status adds cost without benefit

**Annual Cost**: $2,500-55,000 (C-Corp costs + certification)

**Examples**: Patagonia, Ben & Jerry's, Kickstarter, Warby Parker, Allbirds

**VC Funding**: Compatible (VCs can invest in B-Corps). Some impact funds prefer B-Corps.

**Recommendation**: Consider if social/environmental mission is core to business model. Otherwise, standard C-Corp is simpler.

## Decision Framework

### Question 1: Are you raising VC funding (or might someday)?

**YES** → **C-Corp** (Delaware)
- Non-negotiable requirement
- Go directly to C-Corp formation
- Don't waste time on LLC or S-Corp

**NO** → Continue to Question 2

### Question 2: Do you have co-founders or partners?

**NO** (Solo founder) → Continue to Question 3

**YES** (Multiple founders) → Continue to Question 4

### Question 3: Solo Founder - How much revenue/profit do you expect?

**< $50K/year** → **Sole Proprietorship** (simplest)
- Or single-member LLC for liability protection
- Minimal complexity

**$50K-200K/year** → **Single-Member LLC**
- Liability protection
- Can elect S-Corp taxation if profitable

**> $200K/year** → **LLC electing S-Corp** or **C-Corp**
- LLC + S-Corp election for tax savings
- C-Corp if might raise funding later

### Question 4: Multiple Founders - What's the plan?

**Bootstrap, stay small** → **LLC**
- Simple, flexible
- Good for service businesses
- Tax advantages

**Scale quickly, might fundraise** → **C-Corp**
- Start with right structure
- Easier than converting later

**Professional services (law, accounting, medicine)** → **LLP** or **LLC**
- Check state requirements for your profession
- Some states require LLP for certain professions

### Question 5: What type of business?

**High liability risk** (product, public, employees):
- **Must have**: Corporation or LLC
- **Never use**: Sole proprietorship or partnership

**Low liability risk** (solo consulting, writing):
- Can use: Any structure
- Simplest: Sole proprietorship or single-member LLC

**Real estate investment**:
- Best: LLC (separate LLC for each property)
- Liability isolation + tax benefits

## Conversion Between Entity Types

### Sole Proprietorship → LLC or C-Corp
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Cost**: $100-800 (filing fees)
- **Process**: Form new entity, transfer assets
- **Time**: 1-2 weeks

### LLC → C-Corp
- **Difficulty**: Moderate
- **Cost**: $1,000-5,000 (legal + tax advice)
- **Process**: Tax-free conversion (if done correctly) or dissolution + formation
- **Time**: 2-4 weeks
- **Tax impact**: Can be tax-free if structured properly
- **Common**: Many startups do this before first VC round

### S-Corp → C-Corp
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Cost**: $500-1,500
- **Process**: Revoke S election or wait for automatic termination
- **Time**: Immediate (or next tax year)
- **Common**: Done before VC funding

### Partnership → LLC or C-Corp
- **Difficulty**: Moderate
- **Cost**: $1,000-3,000
- **Process**: Convert or dissolve + form new
- **Time**: 2-4 weeks

### C-Corp → LLC
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Cost**: $5,000-15,000+ (major tax consequences)
- **Process**: Dissolution + formation (usually taxable)
- **Tax impact**: Often triggers immediate tax on appreciation
- **Recommendation**: Avoid if possible; very expensive

### C-Corp → S-Corp (Tax Election)
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Cost**: $0-500
- **Process**: File Form 2553
- **Time**: Must meet deadlines (March 15 or 75 days from formation)
- **Limitation**: Must meet S-Corp eligibility requirements

**Key Takeaway**: Easy to go from simple → complex. Hard and expensive to go from complex → simple. Start with right structure or start simple and upgrade.

## Startup-Specific Recommendations

### Pre-Revenue Testing Phase
**Recommendation**: Sole Proprietorship or Partnership (informal)
- No formation needed
- Test idea before commitment
- When ready to commit: Form C-Corp (if VC track) or LLC (if bootstrap)

### Raising Friends & Family Round (<$500K)
**Recommendation**: C-Corp (Delaware)
- Even small rounds easier with C-Corp
- Use SAFE or Convertible Note
- Sets up for institutional funding later

### Raising Seed/Series A ($500K+)
**Recommendation**: C-Corp (Delaware) (Required)
- Non-negotiable for VCs
- Should already be formed before raising

### Bootstrapping Forever
**Recommendation**: LLC (home state or Wyoming)
- Tax advantages
- Simplicity
- No investor requirements

### SaaS Product Business
**Recommendation**:
- **Planning to raise funding**: C-Corp (Delaware)
- **Bootstrapping**: LLC → elect S-Corp when profitable

### Service Business (Agency, Consulting)
**Recommendation**: LLC
- Simple structure
- Tax flexibility
- Unlikely to raise VC funding

### Hardware/Physical Product
**Recommendation**: C-Corp (Delaware)
- Liability protection important
- Often requires VC funding (capital intensive)
- Patents/IP easier with C-Corp

## Tax Comparison Table

| Entity | Tax Type | Tax Rate | Self-Employment Tax | Complexity |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Sole Prop | Pass-through | Ordinary income | 15.3% on all profit | Very Low |
| Partnership | Pass-through | Ordinary income | 15.3% on all profit | Low |
| LLC (default) | Pass-through | Ordinary income | 15.3% on all profit | Low-Medium |
| LLC (S-Corp) | Pass-through | Ordinary income | Only on salary | Medium-High |
| S-Corp | Pass-through | Ordinary income | Only on salary | High |
| C-Corp | Corporate | 21% corporate + 15-20% dividend | None (salary subject to payroll) | High |
| B-Corp | Corporate | 21% corporate + 15-20% dividend | None | Very High |

## Liability Protection Comparison

| Entity | Liability Protection | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Sole Prop | **None** | Personal assets at risk |
| Partnership | **None** (GP) | Each partner liable for all debts |
| Partnership | **Limited** (LP, LLP) | Limited partners protected |
| LLC | **Strong** | Personal assets protected |
| S-Corp | **Strong** | Personal assets protected |
| C-Corp | **Strongest** | Extensive legal framework |
| B-Corp | **Strongest** | Same as C-Corp |

**Important**: Liability protection requires:
- Keeping business and personal finances separate
- Maintaining corporate formalities (meetings, minutes)
- Adequate capitalization
- Not personally guaranteeing debts

Piercing corporate veil (losing protection) happens when:
- Commingling personal and business funds
- Inadequate capitalization (underfunded)
- Fraud or illegal activity
- Not following corporate formalities

## Funding Compatibility

| Entity | Friends & Family | Angel Investors | VC Funding | Bank Loans | Crowdfunding |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Sole Prop | Difficult | No | No | Limited | Limited |
| Partnership | Difficult | No | No | Limited | Limited |
| LLC | Possible | Difficult | No | Yes | Yes |
| S-Corp | Possible | Difficult | No | Yes | Yes |
| C-Corp | **Easy** | **Easy** | **Yes** | Yes | Yes |
| B-Corp | Easy | Easy | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Why VCs Require C-Corp**:
1. **Preferred Stock**: VCs need liquidation preferences, anti-dilution protection
2. **Tax Treatment**: VCs are tax-exempt, can't have pass-through K-1 income
3. **Shareholders**: VCs are corporations/funds, not individuals (S-Corp incompatible)
4. **Scale**: Unlimited shareholders needed for growth
5. **Exit**: IPO or acquisition requires C-Corp structure

## State Selection for Formation

### Delaware
**Best For**: VC-backed startups, high-growth companies

**Pros**:
- Court of Chancery (specialized business court)
- 200+ years of corporate case law
- VC/investor expectation
- Privacy (don't list officers publicly)
- Flexible corporate law

**Cons**:
- Must foreign qualify in home state (double registration)
- Franchise tax ($450/year minimum)
- Registered agent fee ($50-300/year)

**Total Annual Cost**: ~$800-1,050/year

### Home State
**Best For**: Small businesses, local operations

**Pros**:
- Only one state registration
- Lower total cost
- No foreign qualification needed
- Familiar with local law

**Cons**:
- Converting to Delaware later is expensive
- Less favorable corporate law
- May have higher annual fees (California: $800/year)

**Total Annual Cost**: Varies by state ($0-800/year)

### Wyoming
**Best For**: LLCs, privacy-focused businesses

**Pros**:
- Low annual fees ($60/year)
- Strong privacy protections
- No state income tax
- Business-friendly

**Cons**:
- VCs don't prefer Wyoming (use Delaware instead)
- Less established legal framework
- Must foreign qualify in operating state

**Total Annual Cost**: ~$60-200/year

**Recommendation**:
- **VC-backed startup**: Delaware (required)
- **Small business/lifestyle**: Home state (simplest)
- **LLC/privacy**: Wyoming or Delaware

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Choosing S-Corp for Startup
**Problem**: Prevents VC funding, limits growth
**Fix**: Use C-Corp from start if any chance of raising funding

### Mistake 2: Operating as Partnership by Default
**Problem**: Unlimited personal liability, no protection
**Fix**: Form LLC or C-Corp when 2+ founders commit

### Mistake 3: Using Home State for VC-Backed Startup
**Problem**: Must convert to Delaware later (expensive)
**Fix**: Start with Delaware C-Corp if raising VC

### Mistake 4: Using LLC Planning to Raise VC
**Problem**: VCs can't invest in LLCs
**Fix**: Convert to C-Corp before fundraising (or start with C-Corp)

### Mistake 5: Electing S-Corp Too Early
**Problem**: Adds complexity before profit, limits future funding
**Fix**: Stay as C-Corp or wait until profitable to elect S-Corp (and only if not raising VC)

### Mistake 6: Mixing Entity Purposes
**Problem**: Choosing C-Corp for small service business (unnecessary complexity)
**Fix**: Match entity to business type (service = LLC, VC-backed = C-Corp)

## Quick Reference: Choose Your Entity

**I'm a solo freelancer making <$50K/year**
→ **Sole Proprietorship** (add LLC later for liability protection)

**I'm a solo consultant making $50K-200K/year**
→ **Single-Member LLC** (elect S-Corp when profitable)

**I'm bootstrapping a small business with a partner**
→ **LLC** (multi-member)

**I'm building a SaaS product, might raise funding someday**
→ **Delaware C-Corp** (start with right structure)

**I'm definitely raising VC funding**
→ **Delaware C-Corp** (required, non-negotiable)

**I'm running a service agency, staying small**
→ **LLC** (home state)

**I'm building a mission-driven consumer brand**
→ **Delaware B-Corp** (if mission matters) or **C-Corp**

**I'm in real estate investment**
→ **LLC** (one per property for liability isolation)

**I'm a professional (lawyer, doctor, accountant)**
→ **LLP** or **LLC** (check state requirements)
