# Foreign Qualification Guide

## What Is Foreign Qualification?

When you incorporate in one state (e.g., Delaware) but operate in another state (e.g., California), you must register as a "foreign corporation" in the state where you operate.

**"Foreign"** = incorporated in another U.S. state (not international)

## When Is Foreign Qualification Required?

### Always Required If:
- Physical office/warehouse in the state
- Employees working in the state (even remote)
- Retail/sales location in the state
- Significant ongoing business presence

### Sometimes Required:
- Remote contractors in state (depends on state)
- Storing inventory (3PL, Amazon FBA)
- Pop-up events/temporary presence
- Substantial sales volume to state customers

### NOT Required:
- Selling to customers via internet (unless physical presence)
- Attending conferences/meetings
- Having investors in state
- Bank account in state

### Penalties for Not Qualifying

If you fail to register when required:
- **Fines**: $500-5,000+ per year not registered
- **Cannot sue in state courts**: Can't enforce contracts
- **Back taxes and fees**: Owe all years not registered
- **Late fees**: Accumulate over time
