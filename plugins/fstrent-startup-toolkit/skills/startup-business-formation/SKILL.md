## DIY vs Legal Service vs Attorney

### DIY Formation (Using This Skill)
**Best For**: Technical founders comfortable with legal documents, budget-conscious early stage

**Pros**:
- Lowest cost ($1,500-3,000 total first year)
- Complete control and understanding
- Learn the formation process
- Comprehensive templates provided

**Cons**:
- Time-intensive (20-30 hours)
- Risk of errors in legal documents
- No legal review or advice
- Must stay current on law changes

**Recommended When**:
- Pre-funding, bootstrapping
- Simple cap table (1-3 founders)
- No complex IP assignments needed yet
- Comfortable reading legal documents

### Online Legal Services (Stripe Atlas, Clerky, LegalZoom)
**Best For**: Speed and convenience with moderate budget

**Pros**:
- Streamlined process (2-4 weeks)
- Document review by attorneys
- Tested, standard templates
- Moderate cost ($2,000-3,500)
- Good for simple structures

**Cons**:
- Less customization
- Still requires your time (10-15 hours)
- May need attorney later for complex issues
- Upsells for additional services

**Recommended When**:
- Raised pre-seed/friends & family
- Standard founder equity split
- Want professional review
- Value speed over cost savings

### Startup Attorney
**Best For**: Complex situations, high-growth potential, raised funding

**Pros**:
- Expert guidance and advice
- Customized for your situation
- Handles complex cap tables
- IP assignment support
- Prepares for fundraising
- Ongoing legal counsel relationship

**Cons**:
- Highest cost ($3,000-7,000+ formation, $300-600/hour ongoing)
- May be overkill for early stage
- Still requires your input and decisions

**Recommended When**:
- Raised significant funding (seed+)
- Complex cap table or multiple stock classes
- IP assignments from previous employers
- International founders
- Regulated industry
- Planning Series A within 12 months

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Many successful startups use a hybrid approach:

1. **Formation (DIY or Online Service)**: Use this skill or Stripe Atlas/Clerky for initial formation
2. **Legal Review (Attorney)**: Have attorney review documents before signing ($500-1,500)
3. **Fundraising (Attorney)**: Engage attorney for first funding round
4. **Ongoing (As Needed)**: Use attorney for complex issues only

This saves 50-70% vs full attorney formation while getting expert review on critical documents.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Critical Mistakes (Can't Be Fixed Later)
1. **Missing 83(b) Election Deadline**: Must file within 30 days of stock grant. Missing this can cost founders tens of thousands in extra taxes. NO EXCEPTIONS.
2. **Wrong Entity Type**: Converting LLC to C-Corp later is expensive and complicated. Choose C-Corp from start if planning to raise VC funding.
3. **Poor Founder Vesting**: Not having founder vesting can kill future fundraising. Investors require 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff.
4. **No IP Assignment**: Founders must assign IP to company. Can't raise funding without clean IP ownership.

### Expensive Mistakes (Can Be Fixed But Costly)
1. **Incorrect Stock Allocation**: Changing cap table post-funding is complex. Get it right initially.
2. **Missing Foreign Qualification**: Can result in fines, inability to sue in state courts, back taxes.
3. **Inadequate Option Pool**: Too small = need to increase later (dilutes founders). Too large = unnecessary dilution.
4. **No Stockholder Agreement**: Disputes over stock transfers, tag-along/drag-along rights cause problems later.

### Annoying Mistakes (Easy to Fix)
1. **Forgetting Annual Reports**: Late fees are minor but annoying. Set calendar reminders.
2. **Incorrect Minute Book**: Easy to recreate but time-consuming.
3. **No Cap Table Software**: Starting with spreadsheet works, but switching to Carta/Pulley later is easier if you start early.

## Equity Structure Best Practices

### Founder Stock Allocation
**Equal Split (50/50, 33/33/33)**:
- Pros: Simple, shows unity
- Cons: Doesn't reflect contributions, can cause resentment
- Best for: Truly equal co-founders with similar roles

**Weighted by Role**:
- CEO: 30-40%
- CTO: 25-35%
- Other founders: 10-25% each
- Pros: Reflects contribution and responsibility
- Cons: Can be contentious to negotiate
- Best for: Founders with different roles/experience

**Dynamic Equity**:
- Track hours/contributions and adjust equity over time
- Pros: Truly fair based on contribution
- Cons: Complex, ongoing negotiation
- Best for: Early stage with uncertain roles (not recommended for VC fundraising)

### Vesting Schedule (Industry Standard)
**4-Year Vest with 1-Year Cliff**:
- Stock vests over 4 years
- First 25% vests after 1 year (the "cliff")
- Remaining 75% vests monthly over next 3 years
- If founder leaves before 1 year: gets nothing
- If founder leaves after 2 years: keeps 50%

**Why This Matters**:
- Investors require founder vesting (no negotiation)
- Protects remaining founders if someone leaves early
- Standard across all VC-backed startups
- Usually includes acceleration on acquisition (single or double trigger)

**Acceleration Provisions**:
- **Single Trigger**: Vesting accelerates on acquisition (not recommended)
- **Double Trigger**: Accelerates only if acquired AND founder is terminated (standard)
- **Partial Acceleration**: 25-50% accelerates (common middle ground)

### Employee Option Pool
**Initial Pool Size**: 10-20% of post-money equity
- 10-15%: Capital-efficient, SaaS, fewer early hires
- 15-20%: Hardware, requires large team, competitive hiring market

**When to Create**:
- Before first fundraise (comes out of founder equity, not investors)
- Or after fundraise (cleaner cap table initially)

**Option Grant Best Practices**:
- First 10 employees: 0.5-2.0% each (weighted by seniority/risk)
- Employees 11-50: 0.1-0.5% each
- Later employees: 0.01-0.1% each
- 4-year vest with 1-year cliff (same as founders)
- 10-year exercise window (or post-termination exercise period)

## 83(b) Election - CRITICAL

### What Is an 83(b) Election?
An IRS tax election that allows founders to pay taxes on unvested stock at the time of grant (when value is very low) rather than as it vests (when value is higher).

### Why It Matters
**Without 83(b) Election**:
- Year 1: 25% vests, company worth $1M, you owe taxes on $250K income (at ordinary income rates!)
- Year 2: 25% vests, company worth $5M, you owe taxes on $1.25M income
- You owe taxes on paper gains without any cash to pay them (DISASTER)

**With 83(b) Election**:
- Day 1: Pay tax on $1K total value (when par value is $0.001/share)
- Years 1-4: No tax as stock vests
- Exit: All gains taxed at long-term capital gains rates (much lower)

### How to File

**Timeline**: MUST file within 30 days of stock grant date
- No extensions
- No exceptions
- Missing deadline costs tens of thousands in taxes

**Filing Process**:
1. Complete IRS 83(b) election form (see templates/)
2. Make 3 copies
3. Mail original to IRS via certified mail (keep tracking number!)
4. Include copy with your tax return
5. Give copy to company for records
6. Keep copy for your records

**Required Information**:
- Your name, address, SSN
- Company name and EIN
- Grant date
- Number of shares
- Purchase price paid
- Fair market value on grant date (usually same as purchase price initially)

**Cost**: $0 to file, ~$5 for certified mail

**Template Location**: See `templates/83b_election_template.md`

### Common 83(b) Mistakes
1. **Missing the deadline**: Set multiple calendar reminders
2. **Not getting proof of mailing**: Use certified mail with return receipt
3. **Incorrect calculation**: Work with accountant or use template
4. **Forgetting to file copy with tax return**: Can trigger IRS issues

## State-by-State Foreign Qualification

### When Foreign Qualification Is Required
You must qualify as a foreign corporation if you're "doing business" in a state. Definitions vary, but generally include:

**Always Required**:
- Physical office or warehouse in the state
- Employees working in the state
- Significant sales presence (retail location, sales reps)

**Sometimes Required** (depends on state):
- Remote employees in the state (some states require, others don't)
- Pop-up events or temporary presence
- Storing inventory in the state (via 3PL or Amazon FBA)

**Generally NOT Required**:
- Selling to customers in state (via internet)
- Attending conferences
- Having investors in the state
- Independent contractors (not employees)

**Recommendation**: Qualify in your home state (where founders live and company operates) immediately. Add other states only as you establish real presence (hire employees, open office).

## Success Metrics

After using this skill, founders should have:

## Common Questions

### "Should I incorporate before building the product?"
**Answer**: No, you can wait until:
- Hiring first employee (need formal structure for equity)
- Raising funding (investors require C-Corp)
- Generating revenue (need corporate bank account for clean accounting)

Until then, you can operate as sole proprietorship (single founder) or partnership (multiple founders). But incorporate BEFORE any of the above triggers.

### "Can I incorporate myself or do I need a lawyer?"
**Answer**: You can incorporate yourself using this skill's templates. Hire a lawyer if:
- Complex IP situation (prior employment issues)
- International founders
- Already raised funding
- Regulated industry
- Multiple stock classes

For simple formation (1-3 founders, standard equity), DIY works well.

### "What if I miss the 83(b) deadline?"
**Answer**: You face potentially massive tax bills as stock vests. There are NO exceptions or extensions. If you miss it:
- You'll pay ordinary income tax on vesting stock each year
- Tax is based on current value (not grant value)
- Could owe six figures on paper gains with no cash
- Only solution: Restructure equity (expensive) or live with tax burden

This is why we emphasize the 30-day deadline so strongly.

### "How much should I pay myself as a founder?"
**Answer**: Enough to live on (market rate is not required):
- Pre-funding: $0-70K depending on personal situation
- Post-seed: $80K-150K (investors expect some salary)
- Post-Series A: $150K-250K (depends on role and location)

Pay yourself just enough to focus full-time. Save company cash for growth.

### "When should I set up the option pool?"
**Answer**: Two common approaches:
1. Before first fundraise (comes out of founder equity, not investors)
2. After first fundraise (cleaner cap table initially)

Investors will require option pool before they invest, so plan for it. Typical size: 10-20% post-money.

### "Do I need a Delaware office or address?"
**Answer**: No, but you need a Delaware registered agent (a person or service with a Delaware address to receive legal mail). Costs $50-300/year. Popular services:
- Harvard Business Services
- Incfile

### "What's the difference between authorized and issued shares?"
**Answer**:
- **Authorized**: Maximum shares you CAN issue (set in Certificate of Incorporation)
- **Issued**: Shares actually issued to founders/investors
- **Outstanding**: Issued shares not repurchased (usually same as issued)

Typical setup: Authorize 10-20M shares, issue 8-10M to founders initially. Leaves room for option pool and future fundraising without amending Certificate.

### "Should I use par value or no-par stock?"
**Answer**: Delaware allows both. Modern practice:
- Use par value of $0.0001 or $0.001 per share
- Keeps Delaware franchise tax low (Assumed Par Value method)
- Founder purchase price is usually par value (pennies per share)
- Later rounds price at fair market value ($X.XX per share)

### "What's a 409A valuation and when do I need it?"
**Answer**: IRS-required valuation of common stock, needed BEFORE issuing employee stock options. Timeline:
- Not needed for founder stock
- Required before first option grants
- Must be refreshed every 12 months
- Must be refreshed after material events (funding round)
- Costs $2,000-5,000 initially
- Protects against IRS penalties on under-priced options

Providers: Carta, Pulley, Aon, or accounting firms.

## Advanced Topics

### Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS)
Section 1202 allows founders/investors to exclude up to $10M (or 10x basis) in capital gains on C-Corp stock if:
- Held for 5+ years
- C-Corp with <$50M gross assets when stock issued
- Active business (not passive investment)

To qualify:
- Use C-Corp structure (NOT LLC or S-Corp)
- Issue stock properly documented
- Maintain <$50M assets threshold when stock issued
- Hold for 5 years before sale

This can save founders/investors millions in taxes on acquisition.

### Foreign Founders and Visa Issues
Non-US founders face additional complexity:
- Can own/found US C-Corp (no problem)
- Cannot legally WORK for US company without work visa
- Solutions: Remote work, E-2 treaty investor visa, O-1 visa
- Need ITIN or SSN for tax filings
- May need tax treaty analysis

Recommend attorney for international founder situations.

### Delaware vs Wyoming/Nevada
Some claim Wyoming/Nevada are better than Delaware due to:
- Lower annual fees
- No state income tax
- Strong privacy protections

**Reality for VC-backed startups**:
- VC investors require Delaware (non-negotiable)
- Delaware Court of Chancery is gold standard
- Wyoming/Nevada work fine for small business/lifestyle businesses
- Converting from WY/NV to Delaware later is expensive

Use Delaware if planning to raise VC. Use home state or WY/NV if bootstrapping indefinitely.

### Convertible Equity for Initial Funding
Friends & family funding often uses:
- **SAFE** (Simple Agreement for Future Equity): Y Combinator standard
- **Convertible Note**: Traditional instrument with interest rate

Both delay valuation until Series A. Benefits:
- Avoid valuing company early
- Simpler legal documents
- Lower legal costs ($5K-15K vs $25K-50K for priced round)

Recommend for pre-seed (<$1M). Use priced round for seed+ ($1M+).

### Board Structure Evolution
**Initially (formation)**:
- 1-3 directors (founders only)
- Informal governance

**Post-Seed**:
- Add investor director (typically 1 board seat)
- 3-5 total directors
- Start formal board meetings (quarterly)

**Post-Series A**:
- Investor directors (2-3 seats)
- Founder/management directors (2-3 seats)
- Independent director (1 seat)
- 5-7 total directors
- Formal governance, committees (audit, compensation)

Plan board structure as you scale.

### State Tax Nexus
Having Delaware C-Corp doesn't avoid state taxes. You pay state income tax where you have "nexus":
- Physical presence (office, employees, inventory)
- Economic nexus (varies by state, ~$100K-500K sales)

Many startups have nexus in:
- Delaware (minimal, no state income tax on out-of-state business)
- Home state (where founders/employees work)
- Customer states (if sales threshold met)

Work with accountant on multi-state tax compliance.

## Skill Maintenance
