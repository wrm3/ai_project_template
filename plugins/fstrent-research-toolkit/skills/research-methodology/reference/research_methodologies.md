- **Under-synthesis**: Don't just list findings, analyze them
- **Ignoring grey literature**: Consider diverse sources

### Rapid Evidence Assessment Pitfalls
- **Over-confidence**: Note limitations clearly
- **Single-source dependency**: Get at least 3 sources
- **Outdated info**: Check dates carefully
- **Insufficient caveats**: Be explicit about rapid nature

### Comparative Analysis Pitfalls
- **Incomplete comparison**: Research all options equally
- **Biased criteria**: Choose objective, relevant criteria
- **Ignoring context**: Use case matters significantly
- **No clear recommendation**: Actually make a recommendation

### Technical Investigation Pitfalls
- **Skipping fundamentals**: Understand basics first
- **Example-only learning**: Read actual documentation
- **No real-world validation**: Find actual usage examples
- **Ignoring versions**: Version matters for technical info

## Research Process Best Practices

### Before Starting
1. Clarify exact question
2. Understand decision context
3. Choose appropriate methodology
4. Estimate time needed
5. Set scope boundaries

### During Research
1. Document as you go
2. Capture citations immediately
3. Organize continuously
4. Check for bias
5. Verify critical claims
6. Note confidence levels

### After Research
1. Synthesize findings
2. Provide clear recommendations

4. Create professional artifact
5. Store for reference
6. Link to relevant tasks

## Combining Methodologies

### Progressive Research
Start rapid, go deeper if needed:
1. **Phase 1**: Rapid Evidence Assessment (30 min)
2. **Phase 2**: If needed, Comparative Analysis (2 hrs)
3. **Phase 3**: If needed, Systematic Literature Review (4+ hrs)

### Parallel Research
Use multiple approaches simultaneously:
- **Comparative Analysis** for options
- **Technical Investigation** for implementation details
- **Trend Analysis** for future-proofing

### Sequential Research
Each phase informs the next:
1. **Scoping Study** (determine if research is viable)
2. **Systematic Literature Review** (if scoping shows promise)
3. **Technical Investigation** (for chosen approach)
4. **Problem-Solution Research** (for implementation challenges)
