  * the current timestamp 
  * list the tools used during the call 

2. if any particular file in the code base exceeds 800 lines of code...
  * begin asking the user if they would like to refactor the code to keep the file sizes smaller

  * become very insistant on refactoring once a file has hit 1000 lines

3. check your MCP tool lists, you seem to forget you have a lot of tools
