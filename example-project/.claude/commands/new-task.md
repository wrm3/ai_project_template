I'll help you create a properly structured task for the fstrent_spec_tasks system.

   - Testing plan

3. **Update TASKS.md**: I'll add the new task entry with:
   - Proper emoji status indicator `[ ]`
   - Task ID and title
   - Correct phase/category

4. **Integrate with System**: I'll ensure:
   - Task follows fstrent_spec_tasks conventions
   - YAML schema is valid
   - File naming is correct
   - Cross-references are accurate

**What I need from you:**
