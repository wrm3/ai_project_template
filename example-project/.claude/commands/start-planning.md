Let's start planning your project: $ARGUMENTS

I'll guide you through the fstrent_spec_tasks planning process to create a comprehensive project plan.

**Planning Workflow:**

1. **Scope Validation** (5 Essential Questions):
   - **User Context**: Personal use, small team, or broader deployment?
   - **Security Requirements**: Minimal, standard, enhanced, or enterprise?
   - **Scalability Expectations**: Basic, moderate, high, or enterprise?
   - **Feature Complexity**: Minimal, standard, feature-rich, or enterprise?
   - **Integration Requirements**: Standalone, basic, standard, or enterprise?

2. **Create PLAN.md** (Product Requirements Document):
   - Product overview (title, version, summary)
   - Goals (business, user, non-goals)
   - User personas and roles
   - Features with priorities
   - User experience flows
   - Narrative
   - Success metrics
   - Technical considerations
   - Milestones & sequencing
   - User stories

3. **Create PROJECT_CONTEXT.md**:
   - Project mission statement
   - Current phase and focus
   - Success criteria
   - Scope boundaries
   - Key constraints

4. **Create SUBSYSTEMS.md**:
   - Component registry
   - Subsystem descriptions
   - Dependencies
   - Ownership

5. **Initial Feature Documents**:
   - Create features/ folder
   - Document core features
   - Link to PLAN.md

**Benefits of This Process:**
- ✅ Prevents over-engineering
- ✅ Clarifies scope and boundaries
- ✅ Aligns team on goals
- ✅ Provides clear success metrics
- ✅ Creates comprehensive documentation

**What I need from you:**
- Brief project description
- Primary goals
- Target users
- Key features (high-level)

Let's build the right thing at the right complexity level!
