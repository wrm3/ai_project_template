Generating project status overview...

I'll provide a comprehensive status update for your fstrent_spec_tasks project.

**Status Overview Workflow:**

1. **Analyze Tasks** (from TASKS.md): I'll review:
   - Total tasks by phase
   - Tasks by status (Pending, In-Progress, Completed, Failed)
   - Tasks by priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Recently completed tasks
   - Blocked or stalled tasks
   - Task completion velocity

2. **Analyze Bugs** (from BUGS.md): I'll examine:
   - Total open bugs by severity
   - Critical/High priority bugs
   - Bug resolution rate
   - Recently closed bugs
   - Long-standing bugs

3. **Analyze Features** (from PLAN.md and features/): I'll check:
   - Total features planned
   - Features in development
   - Features completed
   - Feature progress percentage

4. **Identify Issues**: I'll highlight:
   - **Blockers**: Tasks waiting on dependencies
   - **Risks**: High-priority tasks not started
   - **Delays**: Tasks taking longer than estimated
   - **Critical Bugs**: Urgent issues needing attention

5. **Generate Status Report**: I'll create:
   - Executive summary
   - Task progress by phase
   - Bug status summary
   - Feature completion status
   - Blockers and risks
   - Next priorities
   - Recommendations

**Status Report Sections:**

### üìã Task Summary

- Resolution rate: X bugs/week
- Critical issues: [List]

### üéØ Feature Progress
- Features: X total (Y complete, Z in-progress)
- Current focus: [Feature name]
- Next up: [Feature name]

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers & Risks

- High-priority delays: [List]
- Critical bugs: [List]

### üöÄ Next Priorities
1. [Priority 1]
2. [Priority 2]
3. [Priority 3]

**What I need from you:**
- Any specific areas to focus on (optional)
- Time period for "recent" (default: last 7 days)

Let's see where your project stands!
