Generating quality metrics report...

I'll analyze your project's quality metrics from the fstrent_spec_tasks QA system.

**Quality Report Workflow:**

1. **Analyze BUGS.md**: I'll examine:
   - Total bugs (active and closed)
   - Bugs by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Bugs by source (User Reported, Development, Testing, Production)
   - Bugs by status (Open, Investigating, Fixing, Testing, Closed)
   - Bug age and resolution time

2. **Calculate Metrics**: I'll compute:
   - **Bug Discovery Rate**: Bugs found per time period
   - **Bug Resolution Time**: Average time from discovery to resolution
   - **Severity Distribution**: Percentage breakdown by severity
   - **Feature Impact Analysis**: Which features have most bugs
   - **Regression Rate**: Bugs introduced by fixes
   - **Quality Gate Performance**: Pass rates for code review, testing, etc.

3. **Identify Trends**: I'll analyze:
   - Bug discovery trend (increasing/decreasing)
   - Resolution time trend (improving/degrading)
   - Severity distribution changes
   - Feature quality patterns
   - Production bug rate

4. **Generate Report**: I'll create:
   - Executive summary
   - Detailed metrics with charts
   - Trend analysis
   - Quality gate performance
   - Recommendations
   - Focus areas for improvement

**Report Sections:**
- Executive Summary
- Bug Metrics (discovery, resolution, severity, feature impact)
- Quality Gates Performance
- Trends (6-month view)
- Achievements
- Focus Areas
- Recommendations

**Report Formats:**
- Daily: Quick status update
- Weekly: Detailed metrics and trends
- Monthly: Comprehensive analysis with recommendations

**What I need from you:**
- Report period (daily, weekly, monthly, custom)
- Specific areas of concern (optional)
- Comparison period (optional)

Let's assess your project's quality!
