# Task 42: Migrate User Data from Legacy System

## Objective
Safely migrate 500,000 user records from the legacy MySQL database to the new PostgreSQL system while maintaining data integrity and zero downtime.

## Background
The legacy system is reaching end-of-life and must be decommissioned by Q4. This migration is the final blocker for the cutover.

## Complexity Assessment
**Score: 9/10** (Requires sub-task breakdown)
- Large data volume (500K records)
- Multiple subsystems affected
- Zero-downtime requirement
- Data validation critical

## Sub-Tasks
This task has been broken down into manageable sub-tasks:
- Task 42.1: Setup database schema
- Task 42.2: Implement data extraction
- Task 42.3: Create data transformation pipeline
- Task 42.4: Implement data validation
- Task 42.5: Execute migration with rollback plan

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 500,000 user records migrated successfully
- [ ] Data integrity verified (100% match)
- [ ] Zero downtime during migration
- [ ] Rollback plan tested and ready
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (< 2 hour migration window)
- [ ] Legacy system data archived
- [ ] Migration documented

## Implementation Notes
- Use blue-green deployment strategy
- Migrate in batches of 10,000 records
- Implement checkpointing for resume capability
- Monitor database performance during migration
- Keep legacy system in read-only mode during migration

## Risk Mitigation
- Full database backup before migration
- Staged rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Automated rollback triggers
- 24/7 on-call team during migration

## Success Metrics
- Migration completion time < 2 hours
- Zero data loss
- Zero downtime
- < 0.1% error rate
- All validation checks pass
