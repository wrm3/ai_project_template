# Task 15: [BUG] Login Button Not Responding

## Objective
Fix critical bug preventing users from accessing login functionality.

## Bug Details
**Bug Reference**: BUG-001  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Source**: Production  
**Environment**: All browsers, Windows 11, macOS  
**Reported**: 2025-10-18 14:30 UTC  
**Impact**: 100% of users unable to login

## Reproduction Steps
1. Navigate to homepage (https://app.example.com)
2. Click "Login" button in top-right corner
3. Observe no response

**Result**: Button appears clickable but nothing happens. No console errors, no network requests.

## Expected vs Actual Behavior
**Expected**: Login modal should appear with email/password fields  
**Actual**: Button click has no visual or functional effect

## Root Cause Analysis
Event listener was removed during refactoring in commit abc123. The button element exists in the DOM but has no click handler attached. The refactoring moved authentication logic to a new module but forgot to re-attach the event listener.

## Fix Implementation
1. Restored click event listener in `auth.js` line 42
2. Added unit test to verify listener is attached on page load
3. Added integration test for complete login flow
4. Updated refactoring checklist to prevent similar issues

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// auth.js
document.getElementById('login-btn').addEventListener('click', showLoginModal);
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [✅] Login button responds to clicks
- [✅] Login modal appears correctly
- [✅] Unit test confirms event listener present
- [✅] Integration test covers full login flow
- [✅] Fix verified in production
- [✅] No regressions in related functionality

## Testing Performed
- ✅ Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- ✅ Tested on Windows, macOS, Linux
- ✅ Tested on mobile devices (iOS, Android)
- ✅ Verified no console errors
- ✅ Checked analytics for successful logins (restored to normal levels)

## Resolution
**Fixed**: 2025-10-18 16:45 UTC  
**Deployed**: 2025-10-18 17:00 UTC  
**Verified**: 2025-10-18 17:15 UTC  
**Downtime**: 2 hours 45 minutes

## Lessons Learned
1. Always run full integration tests after refactoring
2. Event listener attachment should be tested
3. Consider using framework event binding (React/Vue) to prevent this
4. Add pre-deployment smoke tests for critical user flows
