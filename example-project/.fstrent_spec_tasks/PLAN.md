## 6. Narrative
Sarah, a freelance web developer, opens TaskFlow in her browser. She quickly creates tasks for her current client project, setting priorities and due dates. Throughout the day, she updates task statuses as she works, using the simple interface to stay organized. When a client calls with a new urgent request, she creates a high-priority task and immediately sees it at the top of her list. By the end of the week, she filters by completed tasks to review her progress and feels satisfied seeing her accomplishments.

## 7. Success metrics

### 7.1 User-centric metrics
- Task creation rate (tasks created per user per week)
- Task completion rate (% of tasks marked complete)
- User retention (users returning after first week)
- Time to create first task (<2 minutes)

### 7.2 Business metrics
- User adoption (new users per month)
- Active users (users with activity in last 30 days)
- Feature usage (which features are used most)

### 7.3 Technical metrics
- Page load time (<1 second)
- Error rate (<1% of requests)
- Uptime (>99.5%)
- Database query performance (<100ms average)

## 8. Technical considerations

### 8.1 Affected subsystems
- **Primary subsystems** (directly modified/extended):
  - Web Application: Flask routes, templates, forms
  - Database Layer: SQLite schema, models, queries
  - Authentication: Session management, user context
  
- **Secondary subsystems** (indirectly affected):
  - Testing: Unit tests, integration tests
  - Documentation: API docs, user guides
  - Deployment: Configuration, environment setup

### 8.2 Integration points
- SQLite database (local file-based)
- Flask session management
- Jinja2 template engine
- WTForms for form handling

### 8.3 Data storage & privacy
- SQLite database stored locally
- No external data transmission (self-hosted)
- User passwords hashed with bcrypt (future)
- Session data stored server-side
- No analytics or tracking

### 8.4 Scalability & performance
- Designed for 1-50 concurrent users
- SQLite sufficient for <100,000 tasks
- Simple caching for frequently accessed data
- Pagination for large task lists (50 tasks per page)
- No real-time features (reduces complexity)

### 8.5 Potential challenges
- SQLite limitations for concurrent writes (acceptable for small teams)
- Session management in multi-server deployments (future concern)
- Search performance with large datasets (can add full-text search later)
- Mobile UX optimization (requires responsive design testing)
