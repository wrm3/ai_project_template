# Task 006: Add priority system with visual indicators

## Objective
Implement a priority system for tasks with four levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and add visual indicators (colors, icons) to make priorities immediately recognizable in the UI.

## Requirements

### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Urgent, blocking issues (Red)
- **High**: Important, should be done soon (Orange)
- **Medium**: Normal priority (Yellow)
- **Low**: Nice to have, can wait (Green)

### Database Changes
```python
# Add to Task model
priority = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False, default='medium')
# Allowed values: 'critical', 'high', 'medium', 'low'
```

### UI Changes
- Color-coded priority badges
- Priority icons (‚ö†Ô∏è Critical, üî¥ High, üü° Medium, üü¢ Low)
- Priority dropdown in task form
- Priority filter in sidebar

### Visual Design
```css
.priority-critical { background: #dc3545; color: white; }
.priority-high { background: #fd7e14; color: white; }
.priority-medium { background: #ffc107; color: black; }
.priority-low { background: #28a745; color: white; }
```

## Implementation Progress

### Completed
- [‚úÖ] Updated Task model with priority field
- [‚úÖ] Created database migration
- [‚úÖ] Added priority dropdown to task form
- [‚úÖ] Implemented priority validation

### In Progress
- [üîÑ] Creating CSS styles for priority badges
- [üîÑ] Adding priority icons to task list

### Pending
- [ ] Implement priority sorting
- [ ] Add priority filter to sidebar
- [ ] Write unit tests for priority functionality
- [ ] Update documentation

## Technical Notes

Using Bootstrap badge classes as base, customizing colors to match priority levels. Icons are Unicode emojis for cross-platform compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Task model includes priority field
- [ ] Priority can be set when creating task
- [ ] Priority can be updated after creation
- [ ] Visual indicators show priority clearly
- [ ] Tasks can be sorted by priority
- [ ] Tasks can be filtered by priority
- [ ] All tests pass

## Blockers

None currently. Waiting on UI design review for final color choices.

## Next Steps

1. Finish CSS styling for priority badges
2. Add icons to task list display
3. Implement priority sorting functionality
4. Add priority filter to sidebar
5. Write comprehensive tests
