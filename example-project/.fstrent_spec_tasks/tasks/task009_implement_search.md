# Task 009: Implement search functionality

## Objective
Implement a search feature that allows users to quickly find tasks by searching titles and descriptions. Search should be fast, intuitive, and provide real-time results.

## Requirements

### Search Capabilities
- Search task titles (case-insensitive)
- Search task descriptions (case-insensitive)
- Real-time search (updates as user types)
- Debounced to avoid excessive queries
- Clear indication when no results found

### UI Components
- Search box in top navigation bar
- Search icon/button
- Clear search button (X)
- Result count display
- Highlight search terms in results (optional)

### Backend Implementation
```python
@app.route('/search')
def search_tasks():
    query = request.args.get('q', '')
    if len(query) < 2:
        return jsonify([])
    
    tasks = Task.query.filter(
        db.or_(
            Task.title.ilike(f'%{query}%'),
            Task.description.ilike(f'%{query}%')
        )
    ).all()
    
    return jsonify([task.to_dict() for task in tasks])
```

### Frontend Implementation
- JavaScript for real-time search
- Debounce function (300ms delay)
- AJAX requests to search endpoint
- Update task list with results

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Add database indexes on title and description columns
- Limit results to 50 tasks
- Consider full-text search for large datasets (future)

### User Experience
- Minimum 2 characters to trigger search
- Show "Searching..." indicator
- Show "No results found" message
- Preserve filter state during search

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements
- Focus management

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Search box visible in navigation
- [ ] Search updates results as user types (debounced)
- [ ] Search matches both title and description
- [ ] Search is case-insensitive
- [ ] Clear button resets search
- [ ] Result count displayed
- [ ] No results message shown when appropriate
- [ ] Search works with existing filters
- [ ] Keyboard accessible
- [ ] All tests pass

## Dependencies

**Blocked by**:
- Task 004: Basic CRUD routes (completed)
- Task 007: Task filtering functionality (in progress)

**Blocks**:
- None

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend (2 hours)
1. Create search route
2. Implement query logic
3. Add database indexes
4. Test with sample data

### Phase 2: Frontend (3 hours)
1. Create search UI component
2. Implement JavaScript search logic
3. Add debouncing
4. Handle edge cases

### Phase 3: Integration (1 hour)
1. Integrate with existing filters
2. Test all combinations
3. Fix any issues

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test search query logic
- Test case-insensitivity
- Test partial matches
- Test empty queries

### Integration Tests
- Test search with filters
- Test search with sorting
- Test search with pagination

### Manual Testing
- Test on different browsers
- Test with keyboard only
- Test with screen reader
- Test performance with large datasets

## Notes

Consider using SQLite FTS (Full-Text Search) for better performance if dataset grows large. For MVP, simple LIKE queries should be sufficient.
