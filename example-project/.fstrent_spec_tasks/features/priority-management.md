# Feature: Priority Management

## Overview
Allow users to assign priority levels to tasks and visually distinguish between different priority levels to help users focus on important work.

## Requirements

### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Urgent, blocking issues (Red, ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- **High**: Important, should be done soon (Orange, üî¥)
- **Medium**: Normal priority (Yellow, üü°)
- **Low**: Nice to have, can wait (Green, üü¢)

### Functional Requirements
- Users can set priority when creating a task
- Users can update priority after task creation
- Tasks display visual priority indicators (colors, icons)
- Tasks can be sorted by priority
- Tasks can be filtered by priority
- Default priority is "Medium" if not specified

## User Stories

### US-007: Set Task Priority
**As a** user  
**I want to** set task priority  
**So that** I can organize work by importance

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Priority options: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Visual indicators for each priority level
- Can set priority when creating task
- Can update priority after creation
- Tasks can be sorted by priority

**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 3

## Technical Considerations

### Database Changes
```python
# Add to Task model
priority = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False, default='medium')
# Allowed values: 'critical', 'high', 'medium', 'low'
```

### UI Components
- Priority dropdown in task form
- Priority badges in task list
- Priority icons
- Priority filter in sidebar
- Priority sort option

### CSS Styling
```css
.priority-critical { background: #dc3545; color: white; }
.priority-high { background: #fd7e14; color: white; }
.priority-medium { background: #ffc107; color: black; }
.priority-low { background: #28a745; color: white; }
```

## Dependencies

### Required Features
- Task Management (Task model must exist)

### Dependent Features
- Task Filtering (will include priority filter)
- Task Sorting (will include priority sort)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [‚úÖ] Task model includes priority field
- [‚úÖ] Priority can be set when creating task

## Related Tasks

### Completed
- Task 003: Implement Task model (added priority field)

### In Progress
- Task 006: Add priority system with visual indicators

### Pending
- Task 008: Implement task sorting (will include priority sort)

## Related Bugs

- BUG-002: Priority filter not persisting across sessions (High)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test priority validation
- Test default priority
- Test priority updates
- Test invalid priority values

### Integration Tests
- Test priority in task creation
- Test priority in task updates
- Test priority sorting
- Test priority filtering

## Performance Considerations

- Index on `priority` field for fast filtering/sorting
- Cache priority filter state in session

## Future Enhancements

- Custom priority levels
- Priority-based notifications
- Automatic priority adjustment based on due date
- Priority history tracking
