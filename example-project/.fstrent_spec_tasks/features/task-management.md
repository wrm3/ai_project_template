# Feature: Task Management

## Overview
Core task management functionality allowing users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. This is the foundational feature of TaskFlow.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Users can create new tasks with title, description, priority, and due date
- Users can view a list of all their tasks
- Users can view detailed information for a specific task
- Users can update task information
- Users can delete tasks (with confirmation)
- Users can mark tasks as complete

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Task creation should complete in <500ms
- Task list should load in <1 second
- Support for at least 10,000 tasks per user
- All operations should be atomic (no partial updates)

## User Stories

### US-001: Create Task
**As a** user  
**I want to** create a new task with a title, description, priority, and due date  
**So that** I can track work I need to do

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can access task creation form from main dashboard
- Form includes fields for title (required), description (optional), priority (required), due date (optional)
- Form validates required fields
- Successfully created task appears in task list
- User receives confirmation message

**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 3

### US-002: Update Task Status
**As a** user  
**I want to** update a task's status  
**So that** I can track its progress

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can change status from Pending → In Progress → Completed
- Status change is immediate and visible
- Status is visually indicated (colors, icons)
- User can also mark task as Cancelled

**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 2

### US-005: View Task Details
**As a** user  
**I want to** view full task details  
**So that** I can see all information about a task

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can click task to view details
- Details show title, description, priority, status, due date, created date
- User can edit task from details view
- User can delete task from details view
- User can return to task list easily

**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 2

### US-006: Delete Task
**As a** user  
**I want to** delete tasks I no longer need  
**So that** my task list stays clean

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can delete task from task list or details view
- Confirmation prompt before deletion
- Task is permanently removed
- User receives confirmation message
- Task list updates immediately

**Priority**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 2

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema
```python
class Task(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(200), nullable=False)
    description = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    status = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False, default='pending')
    priority = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False, default='medium')
    due_date = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /` - List all tasks
- `GET /task/<id>` - View task details
- `POST /task/create` - Create new task
- `POST /task/<id>/update` - Update task
- `POST /task/<id>/delete` - Delete task
- `POST /task/<id>/status` - Update task status

### Subsystems Affected
- **Database Layer**: Task model, CRUD operations
- **Routes**: Task-related endpoints
- **Templates**: Task list, task detail, task form
- **Forms**: Task creation/update forms with validation

## Dependencies

### Required Features
- None (this is the foundation)

### Dependent Features
- Priority Management (extends Task model)
- Task Filtering (queries Task model)
- Search (searches Task model)
- Status Management (updates Task model)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [✅] Task model implemented with all required fields
- [✅] CRUD routes created and tested
- [✅] Task list view displays all tasks
- [✅] Task detail view shows full information
- [✅] Task creation form validates input
- [ ] Task update form pre-populates with existing data
- [ ] Task deletion requires confirmation
- [ ] All operations handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Unit tests cover all CRUD operations
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end workflows

## Related Tasks

### Completed
- Task 001: Set up Flask project structure
- Task 002: Create database schema
- Task 003: Implement Task model
- Task 004: Create basic CRUD routes

### In Progress
- None

### Pending
- Task 015: Fix bug - Task deletion confirmation not showing

## Related Bugs

- BUG-001: Task deletion confirmation not showing (Critical)
- BUG-003: Task due date display incorrect for different timezones (Medium)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test Task model creation
- Test Task model validation
- Test CRUD operations
- Test status transitions
- Test edge cases (empty fields, invalid data)

### Integration Tests
- Test task creation workflow
- Test task update workflow
- Test task deletion workflow
- Test task list pagination
- Test error handling

### Manual Testing
- Create tasks with various combinations of fields
- Update tasks and verify changes persist
- Delete tasks and verify removal
- Test with large numbers of tasks
- Test on different browsers

## Performance Considerations

- Index on `created_at` for sorting
- Index on `status` for filtering
- Pagination for large task lists (50 per page)
- Lazy loading for task descriptions
- Caching for frequently accessed tasks

## Security Considerations

- Validate all user input
- Sanitize HTML in descriptions
- Prevent SQL injection (use ORM)
- CSRF protection on forms
- Rate limiting on task creation

## Future Enhancements

- Task templates
- Bulk operations (delete multiple tasks)
- Task duplication
- Task history/audit log
- Soft delete (trash/archive)
- Task attachments
- Task comments
