## Key Findings

### What Are Claude Skills?
Custom onboarding material that packages expertise, enabling Claude to become a specialist without model retraining.

### Critical Advantage: Context Efficiency
- **MCP Servers:** 3 servers = ~32,000 tokens (16% context window)
- **Skills:** 5 skills = ~750 tokens initial load (0.4% context window)
- **Savings:** ~26,250 tokens (13.6% context)

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern
1. **Metadata:** 100-150 tokens (for skill selection)
2. **Body:** ~5,000 tokens (capabilities and workflows)
3. **Resources:** Unlimited tokens (detailed instructions)

### Main Use Cases
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Code review with custom templates
- Brand guideline enforcement
- Financial analysis patterns
- Any repeatable workflow with specific steps

## Next Steps

1. Review the [ANALYSIS.md](ANALYSIS.md) for conceptual understanding
2. Study the [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for practical application
3. Identify workflows in your projects that could benefit from Skills
4. Experiment with the built-in skill creator
5. Build custom skills for your specific needs

## Context for This Project

This research is relevant to the `ai_project_template` because:
- We already have Skills implemented in `.claude/skills/`
- Understanding progressive disclosure can improve our skill design
- Context efficiency matters for complex projects
- Skills can replace or complement our existing MCP configurations
- Cross-platform compatibility benefits multi-IDE support

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Review existing skills in `.claude/skills/` for optimization
2. Apply progressive disclosure pattern to skill.md files
3. Measure context usage before/after optimization

### Future Enhancements
1. Create skills for project-specific SOPs
2. Build skill templates for common workflows
3. Document skill creation patterns
4. Consider skill sharing with community
