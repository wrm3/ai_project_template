## Quick Summary

This video explains Claude Skills, a new feature from Anthropic that enables repeatable workflows and SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) for AI agents. The key innovation is **progressive disclosure** for context management - Skills only load metadata initially (~150 tokens), then load full capabilities (~5K tokens) when needed, unlike MCP servers which load all tools upfront (~32K tokens).

## Key Insights

### 1. **Progressive Disclosure** (Most Important!)
- **Skills**: Load metadata first (150 tokens), then body (5K tokens) only when needed
- **MCP Servers**: Load ALL tools upfront (~32K tokens, 16% of context)
- **Benefit**: Much more efficient context management, can have many more Skills than MCP servers

### 2. **Skills vs MCP Servers vs Subagents**

| Feature | Skills | MCP Servers | Subagents |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Context** | Progressive disclosure | All tools loaded | Isolated context |
| **Workflow** | Defined, repeatable | Tool-based | Isolated execution |
| **Instructions** | Explicit, hierarchical | Tool descriptions | Separate system prompt |
| **Composability** | High | Medium | Low |
| **Context Efficiency** | Best (150 tokens initial) | Worst (32K tokens) | Isolated |

### 3. **Skills Structure**

```
skill-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md           # Main skill definition (~150 tokens metadata)
â”‚                      # + ~5K tokens capabilities
â”‚                      # + references to other files
â”œâ”€â”€ reference/         # Documentation, schemas
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/          # Usage examples
â””â”€â”€ scripts/           # Tool implementations (Python, etc.)
```

### 4. **"Continual Learning" Concept**

The video claims Skills are "early patterns of continual learning without modifying model weights":
- Add new capabilities by adding new Skills
- Agent learns SOPs and workflows on-the-fly
- No retraining needed
- Well-defined instructions enable execution of previously unseen workflows

**Note**: This is a "crude example" of continual learning, not true continual learning in the ML sense.

### 5. **Skills Can Include**
- Subagents
- MCP servers
- Hierarchical markdown instructions
- Python tools/scripts
- Multiple workflows in one Skill

### 6. **Real-World Examples**

**Anthropic's Internal Skills**:
- File creation capability (uses `skill.md` + Python scripts)
- Canvas design brand guidelines
- **Skill Creator** (Claude can create Skills for you!)
- **MCP Builder** (Claude can create MCP servers!)
- Financial ratio analysis

**Demo in Video**:
- Created a code review Skill
- Showed hierarchical workflow structure
- Demonstrated how Skills follow company-specific templates

### 7. **Skills vs Projects (Claude/ChatGPT)**

| Feature | Skills | Projects |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Documents** | Composable instructions | Knowledge base |
| **Coordination** | Automatic skill selection | Manual |
| **Portability** | Works across Claude apps, API, Claude Code | Platform-specific |
| **Sharing** | Can be shared | Limited |
| **Structure** | Hierarchical workflows | Flat knowledge |

### 8. **Availability**
- âœ… Claude API
- âœ… Claude Code (desktop IDE)
- âœ… Claude Web Interface
- âœ… Claude Desktop App

### 9. **Key Technical Details**

**skill.md Structure**:
1. **Metadata** (~150 tokens): High-level description
2. **Capabilities** (~5K tokens): Available tools and how to use them
3. **Resources** (unlimited): Detailed docs, examples, implementations

**Progressive Loading**:
1. Agent sees all Skill metadata (150 tokens each)
2. User request comes in
3. Agent picks relevant Skills based on similarity
4. Loads full Skill body and starts using tools
5. Can discard and try another Skill if not relevant

**Hierarchical Instructions**:
- skill.md references other .md files
- Each .md file can reference more .md files
- Enables complex, multi-step workflows
- Agent follows instructions step-by-step

### 10. **Best Practices Mentioned**

- Use Skills for **repeatable workflows** and **SOPs**
- Create **company-specific templates** as Skills
- Use **hierarchical structure** for complex workflows
- Provide **clear instructions** on tool usage and order
- Include **examples** and **usage guidelines**
- Think of Skills as "custom onboarding material"

### 11. **Comparison to Other Standards**

**agent.md**:
- Almost every coding agent adopts it
- **Except Claude Code** (uses Skills instead)
- Shows potential divide in standards
- Too early to tell which will win

### 12. **Future Implications**

- Potential for **Skill marketplace** (sharing Skills)
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (API, web, desktop, Claude Code)
- **Standardization** still uncertain
- **Engineering elegance** appreciated by community
- May become industry standard or remain Claude-specific

## Actionable Items for Our Project

### âœ… Already Done
1. Created `fstrent-task-management`, `fstrent-planning`, `fstrent-qa` Skills
2. Added `reference/` folders with documentation
3. Added `examples/` folders with sample files
4. Created `rules.md` files for detailed implementation guidance
5. Used progressive disclosure pattern (metadata in SKILL.md, details in rules.md)

### ðŸ”„ Should Consider
1. **Hierarchical Instructions**: Our Skills could reference additional .md files for complex workflows
2. **Skill Creator**: Use Claude's built-in Skill Creator to generate more Skills
3. **Tool Implementations**: Add Python scripts in `scripts/` folders for actual tool execution
4. **MCP Integration**: Skills can include MCP servers - we could wrap our MCP tools in Skills
5. **Company SOPs**: Create Skills for specific company workflows and templates
6. **Skill Sharing**: Prepare Skills for sharing/marketplace when available

### ðŸ“‹ New Skills to Create
1. **Code Review Skill** (mentioned in video as example)
2. **Brand Guidelines Skill** (for consistent project documentation)
3. **Testing Workflow Skill** (automated testing SOPs)
4. **Deployment Skill** (CI/CD workflows)
5. **Documentation Generation Skill** (auto-generate docs from code)

## Questions & Clarifications Needed

1. **How does Claude decide which Skill to load?**
   - Video mentions "similarity with user request"
   - Is this semantic similarity? Keyword matching?
   - Can we influence this selection?

2. **Can Skills call other Skills?**
   - Video says Skills can include subagents and MCP servers
   - But can Skill A call Skill B?

3. **What's the token limit for Skill resources?**
   - Video says "unlimited tokens" for resources
   - But there must be practical limits?

4. **How are Skills packaged for sharing?**
   - Just a folder with files?
   - Special format?
   - Marketplace coming?

5. **Performance implications?**
   - Does progressive loading add latency?
   - How fast is Skill selection?

6. **Version control for Skills?**
   - How to update Skills?
   - Backward compatibility?

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Our Current Implementation Matches Video Recommendations

**âœ… Metadata in SKILL.md**:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description for skill selection
---
```

**âœ… Progressive Disclosure**:
- SKILL.md: High-level overview (~500-800 words)
- rules.md: Detailed implementation (~8K-9K words)
- reference/: Additional documentation
- examples/: Practical usage

**âœ… Hierarchical Structure**:
- SKILL.md references rules.md
- rules.md references reference/ docs
- examples/ show complete workflows

### Potential Improvements

**Add Python Tool Implementations**:
```python
# scripts/task_manager.py
class TaskManager:
    def create_task(self, title, priority):
        """Create a new task file"""
        # Implementation
        
    def update_status(self, task_id, status):
        """Update task status"""
        # Implementation
```

**Add Hierarchical Instructions**:
```markdown
# SKILL.md
For task creation workflow, see [task_creation.md](reference/task_creation.md)
For bug tracking workflow, see [bug_tracking.md](reference/bug_tracking.md)
```

## Conclusion

**Skills are a game-changer for**:
- âœ… Context management (progressive disclosure)
- âœ… Repeatable workflows and SOPs
- âœ… Company-specific templates
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility
- âœ… Composable, hierarchical instructions

**Our project is well-positioned**:
- Already using Skill structure
