## Key Features

### 1. Clear Architecture Explanation

**Shared Data Layer**:
```
.fstrent_spec_tasks/
├── PLAN.md
├── TASKS.md
├── BUGS.md
├── tasks/
└── features/
```

**IDE-Specific Interfaces**:
- Cursor: `.cursor/rules/`
- Claude Code: `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`

**Result**: Both IDEs read/write the same files with zero conflicts.

### 2. Installation Options

**Three installation paths**:
1. **Both IDEs** - Maximum flexibility for teams
2. **Cursor Only** - Cursor-focused workflow
3. **Claude Code Only** - Claude Code-focused workflow

**Key Insight**: Can add the other IDE interface later with zero data migration!

### 3. Team Collaboration Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Mixed IDE Team**
- Developer A uses Cursor
- Developer B uses Claude Code
- Both work on same Git repository
- Zero friction, perfect collaboration

**Scenario 2: Code Review Across IDEs**
- Reviewer uses Cursor
- Developer uses Claude Code
- Full context preserved across IDEs

**Scenario 3: Pair Programming**
- Each developer uses their preferred IDE
- Both see the same files in real-time
- Switch roles without switching tools

### 4. Comprehensive Feature Comparison

**Feature Matrix**:
- 11 core features compared
- All show 100% parity

1. Commit both interfaces
2. Use descriptive commit messages
3. Keep task IDs unique
4. Sync frequently
5. Use feature branches for major work
6. Document IDE-specific workflows

1. Starting a new project
2. Migrating from Cursor to Claude Code
3. Migrating from Claude Code to Cursor
4. Team member joins with different IDE
5. Switching IDEs mid-project
6. Using both IDEs simultaneously
7. Resolving merge conflicts

**Each scenario includes**:
- Question
- Detailed answer
- Step-by-step instructions
- Expected results

### 7. Troubleshooting

**6 Common Issues**:
1. Changes not appearing in other IDE
2. Task IDs conflict
3. IDE not recognizing system
4. Git merge conflicts in TASKS.md
5. Different behavior between IDEs
6. Performance issues with large projects

**Each issue includes**:

## Technical Highlights

### Data Flow Architecture

```
Git Repository
    ↓
.fstrent_spec_tasks/ (Shared)
    ↓
┌────────┴────────┐
↓                 ↓
Cursor         Claude Code
.cursor/       .claude/
```

**Key Principles**:
1. Single source of truth
2. IDE interfaces as "views"
3. No translation needed
4. Git-friendly
5. Human-readable

### File Format Compatibility

**Shared Format**:
- Standard markdown files
- YAML frontmatter
- Windows-safe emojis
- IDE-agnostic syntax

**Result**: Perfect compatibility with zero conversion.

### Git Workflow

**What to Commit**:
- ✅ `.fstrent_spec_tasks/` (shared data)
- ✅ `.cursor/rules/` (Cursor interface)
- ✅ `.claude/` (Claude Code interface)

**Merge Conflict Resolution**:
- Task files: Usually no conflicts (different files)
- TASKS.md: Most common, easy to resolve
- PLAN.md: Rare, requires discussion
