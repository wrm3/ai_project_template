# How to Share Your Cool Skills for Maximum Street Cred 🌟

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Question:** Where do I check in my Skills to get street cred?

---

## TL;DR - Your Best Strategy

**Do BOTH for maximum impact:**

1. ✅ **Your Own GitHub Repo** (Build your brand, full control)
2. ✅ **Submit to Anthropic's** (Official endorsement, broader reach)

---

## Option 1: Your Own GitHub Repository (Recommended Primary)

### 🏆 Why This is Best for Street Cred

**Pros:**
- ✅ **You own the repo** - Your name/brand in lights
- ✅ **Full control** - No waiting for PR approval
- ✅ **GitHub stars** - Visible popularity metric
- ✅ **Activity graph** - Shows ongoing development
- ✅ **Followers** - Build your developer following
- ✅ **Portfolio piece** - Link from resume/LinkedIn
- ✅ **Contributor graph** - Shows your contribution history
- ✅ **Release notes** - Tell your story with each version
- ✅ **Custom branding** - README with your style

**Examples:**
```
https://github.com/fstrent/fstrent-spec-tasks  ← YOUR REPO
https://github.com/fstrent/awesome-claude-skills
https://github.com/fstrent/youtube-video-analysis-skill
```

### 📊 Street Cred Metrics

## Option 2: Submit to Anthropic's Repository

### 📍 Where to Submit

**Official Repo:** https://github.com/anthropics/skills
