## 🚀 How to Use SubAgents

### Automatic Delegation (Proactive)
SubAgents with "PROACTIVE" triggers activate automatically:

```
# test-runner automatically runs after code changes
You: "I've updated the user authentication logic"
Claude: [Automatically delegates to test-runner]
  → test-runner: Runs test suite
  → test-runner: Diagnoses any failures
  → test-runner: Implements fixes
  → Reports back to main conversation

# task-expander automatically breaks down complex tasks
You: "Implement complete user authentication with OAuth, 2FA, and password reset"
Claude: [Automatically delegates to task-expander]
  → task-expander: Analyzes complexity (score: 12/10 - HIGH)
  → task-expander: Creates 6 sub-tasks
  → Reports breakdown for approval
```

### Explicit Invocation
Manually invoke any SubAgent when needed:

```
# Backend development
You: "Use the backend-developer subagent to create a REST API for user management"

# Security audit
You: "Use the security-auditor subagent to review the authentication code"

# Code review
You: "Use the code-reviewer subagent to review this pull request"

# Documentation
You: "Use the technical-writer subagent to document the API endpoints"
```

### Parallel Workflows
Claude automatically coordinates multiple agents for complex features:

```
You: "Build a complete user authentication feature"

Claude Orchestrates:
  ├─ solution-architect: Designs auth architecture
  ├─ database-expert: Creates user schema and migrations
  ├─ backend-developer: Implements JWT token generation API
  ├─ frontend-developer: Builds login/signup UI components
  ├─ security-auditor: Performs security review
  └─ test-runner: Creates comprehensive test suite

Result: Feature complete in 1/10th the time
```

## 🛠️ Agent Tool Access

### Read-Only Agents (Reviewers & Auditors)
**Tools**: `Read, Grep, Glob` only
- code-reviewer
- security-auditor
- qa-engineer
- solution-architect (read-only analysis)

### Active Development Agents (Implementers)
**Tools**: `Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob`
- backend-developer
- frontend-developer
- database-expert
- devops-engineer
- docker-specialist
- technical-writer
- api-designer
- test-runner

### Full Access Agents (Inherits MCP Tools)
**Tools**: All tools + MCP servers (tools field omitted in config)
- full-stack-developer

## 🔐 Security Configuration

### MCP Integration
SubAgents automatically inherit MCP tools when `tools` field is omitted:

```json
// .claude/settings.local.json
{
  "enableAllProjectMcpServers": true,
  "enabledMcpjsonServers": [
    "fstrent_mcp_tasks",
    "fstrent_mcp_mysql",
    "fstrent_mcp_browser_use",
    "fstrent_mcp_computer_use"
  ]
}
```

### Tool Access Matrix
| Agent Type | Read | Edit | Write | Bash | MCP | Purpose |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-----|---------|
| Reviewer | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | Read-only code review |
| Tester | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | Run tests, fix failures |
| Implementer | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | Write production code |
| Full-Stack | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Complete features |
| Auditor | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | Security analysis |

## 📖 Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Feature Development (Sequential)
```
User: "Add email verification to user registration"

1. solution-architect → Designs email verification architecture
2. database-expert → Adds verification_token and verified_at columns
3. backend-developer → Implements verification endpoints
4. frontend-developer → Creates verification UI
5. test-runner → Adds tests and runs suite (PROACTIVE)
6. security-auditor → Reviews security implications
7. technical-writer → Documents new API endpoints
8. code-reviewer → Final quality check

Result: Complete, tested, documented feature
```

### Workflow 2: Bug Investigation (Specialized)
```
User: "Users are reporting intermittent login failures"

1. debugger → Analyzes error logs and stack traces
2. backend-developer → Reviews authentication code
3. database-expert → Checks for connection pool issues
4. security-auditor → Verifies no security breach
5. devops-engineer → Reviews production monitoring
6. test-runner → Adds regression test
7. qa-engineer → Creates test case for reproduction

Result: Root cause identified, fix implemented, regression prevented
```

### Workflow 3: Production Deployment (Parallel)
```
User: "Deploy version 2.0 to production"

Parallel Tasks:
  ├─ devops-engineer: Prepares deployment pipeline
  ├─ database-expert: Reviews migration scripts
  ├─ security-auditor: Final security check
  ├─ test-runner: Runs full test suite
  └─ technical-writer: Updates changelog

Then Sequential:
  1. devops-engineer: Executes blue-green deployment
  2. qa-engineer: Validates production
  3. devops-engineer: Switches traffic

Result: Zero-downtime deployment with validation
```

### Workflow 4: Code Review Pipeline
```
User: "/review (custom command that triggers review workflow)"

1. code-reviewer → Comprehensive code review
   - Checks: code quality, naming, structure, performance
   - Reports: issues by severity

2. security-auditor → Security-specific review
   - Checks: vulnerabilities, authentication, authorization
   - Reports: security findings

3. test-runner → Runs test suite
   - Executes: all tests
   - Fixes: any failures
   - Reports: coverage metrics

4. Main Agent → Aggregates results
   - Summarizes: all findings
   - Prioritizes: action items
   - Provides: recommendation (approve/request changes)

Result: Comprehensive review in minutes instead of hours
```

## 🔧 Customization & Extension

### Adding New SubAgents
1. Create new `.md` file in `.claude/agents/`
2. Use the template structure (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
3. Define clear, action-oriented description
4. Specify appropriate tool access
5. Test with explicit invocation first
6. Refine description for automatic delegation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### SubAgent Not Being Invoked
**Problem**: Claude doesn't delegate to your subagent

**Solutions**:
1. Check description is action-oriented: "Use PROACTIVELY when..." or "Perform X task..."
2. Explicitly mention the subagent: "Use the [agent-name] subagent to..."
3. Verify file location: `.claude/agents/agent-name.md`
4. Check YAML frontmatter is valid

### SubAgent Lacks Necessary Tools
**Problem**: SubAgent fails due to missing tool access

**Solutions**:
1. Add required tools to frontmatter: `tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash`
2. Omit tools field entirely to inherit all tools including MCP
3. Check MCP configuration in `.claude/settings.local.json`

### Model Not Inherited
**Problem**: SubAgent uses wrong model

**Solutions**:
1. Explicitly specify model: `model: opus` or `model: sonnet`
2. Use `model: inherit` to match main conversation model
3. Note: Known bug where `inherit` sometimes defaults to Sonnet 4

### Context Pollution
**Problem**: SubAgent brings too much irrelevant context

**Solutions**:
1. Make system prompt more focused and specific
2. Narrow tool access to only what's needed
3. Use subagents earlier in conversation (before context grows)
4. Design clear handoff instructions

## 📝 Quick Reference

### List All SubAgents
```bash
ls -1 .claude/agents/
```

### Test a SubAgent
```
You: "Use the [agent-name] subagent to [specific task]"
```

### View SubAgent Configuration
```bash
cat .claude/agents/agent-name.md
```

### Check MCP Configuration
```bash
cat .claude/settings.local.json
```

### Count SubAgents
```bash
ls -1 .claude/agents/*.md | wc -l
# Result: 15
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with Explicit Invocation**: Test agents manually before relying on automatic delegation
2. **Use Parallel Processing**: For multi-component features, let Claude coordinate multiple agents
3. **Trust the Proactive Agents**: test-runner and task-expander work best when they activate automatically
4. **Leverage Read-Only Agents**: Use reviewers and auditors frequently—they can't break anything
5. **Document Your Workflows**: Create custom commands for common multi-agent workflows
6. **Monitor Context Usage**: SubAgents dramatically reduce token usage—measure the impact
7. **Iterate on Descriptions**: If automatic delegation isn't working, refine the description field
8. **Combine with Skills**: SubAgents + Skills + Commands = maximum productivity

## 🤝 Team Collaboration

### Sharing SubAgents
- SubAgents in `.claude/agents/` are project-level (version controlled)
- Team members automatically get agents when they clone the repo
- Personal SubAgents go in `~/.claude/agents/` (not shared)

### Best Practices for Teams
- Review new agents in code reviews
- Document custom workflows
- Share successful patterns
- Iterate based on team feedback
- Maintain agent quality standards
