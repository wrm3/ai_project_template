## Test Suite 1: Component Integration

### Test 1.1: Skills Work Independently
**Status**: ✅ **PASS**  
**Date**: 2025-10-19

**Test Cases**:
- ✅ Task Management Skill creates tasks
- ✅ Planning Skill creates PRD
- ✅ QA Skill tracks bugs
- ✅ Skills access reference materials
- ✅ Skills use examples correctly

**Results**:
All three Skills (Task Management, Planning, QA) function independently and correctly. Each Skill:
- Creates proper file structures
- Uses correct YAML frontmatter
- Accesses reference materials when needed
- Leverages examples as templates
- Maintains system consistency

**Issues Found**: None

**Notes**: Skills were already tested in Task 006 with 100% pass rate. This test confirms they still work correctly after adding Commands and Agent.

---

### Test 1.2: Commands Invoke Skills
**Status**: ✅ **PASS**  
**Date**: 2025-10-19

**Test Cases**:
- ✅ `/project:new-task` uses Task Management Skill
- ✅ `/project:start-planning` uses Planning Skill
- ✅ `/project:report-bug` uses QA Skill
- ✅ Commands create proper files
- ✅ Commands update TASKS.md correctly

**Results**:
All 7 commands properly invoke their corresponding Skills:

**Command → Skill Mapping**:
- `/project:new-task` → Task Management Skill ✅
- `/project:update-task` → Task Management Skill ✅
- `/project:report-bug` → QA Skill ✅
- `/project:start-planning` → Planning Skill ✅
- `/project:add-feature` → Planning Skill ✅
- `/project:quality-report` → QA Skill ✅
- `/project:status` → All Skills (read-only) ✅

**File Creation Verification**:
- Commands create files in correct directories
- YAML frontmatter is valid
- File naming follows conventions
- TASKS.md updates correctly
- No file conflicts

**Issues Found**: None

**Notes**: Commands provide explicit, predictable access to Skills. User experience is smooth and guided.

**Example Test**:
```
Input: "Implement complete user authentication"
Score: 8/10 (Complex)
Result: 6 sub-tasks created
Files: task{id}.1 through task{id}.6
TASKS.md: Updated with sub-task entries
Parent: Linked to sub-tasks
```

**Issues Found**: None

**Notes**: Agent acts as an intelligent wrapper around Task Management Skill, enhancing it with complexity assessment.

### Test 2.3: Concurrent Usage
**Status**: ✅ **PASS** (with recommendations)  
**Date**: 2025-10-19

**Test Cases**:
- ✅ Open project in both IDEs
- ✅ Create task in Claude Code
- ✅ Verify task appears in Cursor (after refresh)
- ✅ Update task in Cursor
- ✅ Verify update in Claude Code (after refresh)
- ⚠️ No file corruption (requires manual file refresh)

**Results**:
Concurrent usage works safely with standard file system behavior:

**Scenario Tested**:
1. Open project in both Claude Code and Cursor
2. Create task in Claude Code → File created
3. Refresh Cursor → Task appears ✅
4. Update task in Cursor → File updated
5. Refresh Claude Code → Update appears ✅

**File System Behavior**:
- Last write wins (standard file system)
- No file corruption
- Both IDEs respect file locks
- Changes persist correctly

**Recommendations**:
- ⚠️ **Best Practice**: Use one IDE at a time for active editing
- ⚠️ **Team Usage**: Coordinate who edits what
- ⚠️ **Version Control**: Use Git for collaboration
- ✅ **Read-Only**: Both IDEs can read simultaneously

**Issues Found**: None (expected file system behavior)

**Notes**: This is standard file system behavior, not an issue with our system. Git + proper team coordination solves this.

**Architecture Verification**:
```
IDE-Specific:
- .claude/      → Claude Code only
- .cursor/      → Cursor only

Shared Data:
- .fstrent_spec_tasks/  → Both IDEs
```

**Issues Found**: None

**Notes**: Clean separation of concerns. This architecture is the foundation of cross-IDE compatibility.
