# Anthropic Skills Marketplace - Current Status

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Question:** Does Anthropic have a marketplace for sharing "Skills"?

---

## ✅ YES - But It's GitHub-Based, Not a Traditional App Store

Anthropic has a **public Skills repository** on GitHub that serves as the marketplace.

---

## Official Skills Repository

### Location
**GitHub:** https://github.com/anthropics/skills

### What It Is
- Public repository for Claude Skills
- Official and community-contributed skills
- Reference implementations and examples
- Free and open-source

### How It Works
```bash
# Install skills from the anthropics/skills repository
# (Exact installation method varies by platform)

# Manual installation
~/.claude/skills/  # Copy skill folders here
```

---

## Current Marketplace Architecture

### Not a Traditional App Store
Unlike npm, pip, or VS Code marketplace, Anthropic's Skills "marketplace" is currently:

❌ **Not centralized** - No single install command like `/plugin install`
❌ **Not automated** - Manual copying of skill folders
❌ **Not versioned** - No semantic versioning system (yet)
❌ **Not searchable** - Browse GitHub repo directly

✅ **Open source** - All skills are GitHub-based
✅ **Free** - No paid skills marketplace
✅ **Community-driven** - Anyone can contribute
✅ **Version controlled** - Git-based versioning

---

## How to Share Skills (Current Method)

### 1. Official Anthropic Repository
**URL:** https://github.com/anthropics/skills

**Process:**
1. Create your skill following SKILL.md format
2. Submit pull request to anthropics/skills
3. If accepted, becomes part of official examples
4. Users can download/copy your skill

### 2. Your Own GitHub Repository
**Example:** https://github.com/yourname/claude-skills

**Process:**
1. Create public GitHub repo with your skills
2. Users clone or download skill folders
3. Users manually copy to `~/.claude/skills/`
4. Share repo URL in community

### 3. Community Curated Lists
**Examples Found:**
- https://github.com/travisvn/awesome-claude-skills
- https://github.com/abubakarsiddik31/claude-skills-collection

**Process:**
1. Add your skill to curated list (PR)
2. Users discover skills through these lists
3. Users install manually

## Your `.claude-plugin/` Folder Context

### Current Reality

Your `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` suggests a **future plugin system** that doesn't fully exist yet:

```json
{
  "name": "fstrent-spec-tasks",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "...",
  "repository": {
    "url": "https://github.com/fstrent/fstrent-spec-tasks"
  }
}
```

This structure is **forward-compatible** with a future Claude Code plugin marketplace.

### What Works Now

**Claude Code Plugins:**
- Anthropic announced "Claude Code Plugins" (separate from Skills)
- Reference: https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-plugins
- May have different marketplace than Skills

**Your Options Today:**

1. **Share on GitHub**
   ```
   https://github.com/fstrent/fstrent-spec-tasks
   Users: git clone and copy to ~/.claude/skills/
   ```

2. **Submit to anthropics/skills**
   ```
   PR to add your skills to official examples
   ```

3. **Add to Community Lists**
   ```
   PR to awesome-claude-skills lists
   ```

---

## Future Marketplace Speculation

### Based on `.claude-plugin/` Structure

Your plugin manifest suggests Anthropic may be building:

**Traditional Plugin Marketplace:**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add fstrent/claude-plugins
/plugin install fstrent-spec-tasks@fstrent
```

**Why Your Structure Suggests This:**
1. `marketplace.json` file exists
2. `plugin.json` format similar to npm/VS Code
3. Versioning and metadata present
4. Repository URLs included

### Timeline: Unknown

- Skills launched: October 2025
- Plugin system: Mentioned, not fully implemented
- Traditional marketplace: Not announced
