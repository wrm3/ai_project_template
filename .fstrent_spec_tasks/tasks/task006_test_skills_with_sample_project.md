# Task 006: Test Skills with Sample Project

## Objective
Thoroughly test all three `fstrent_spec_tasks` Claude Code Skills to ensure they:
1. Activate correctly when needed
2. Can access and use reference materials
3. Examples work as templates
4. Maintain 100% compatibility with Cursor's `.fstrent_spec_tasks/` files
5. Provide value to users

## Background
We've created three comprehensive Skills with reference materials and examples. Before moving to Phase 2, we need to validate that everything works as intended in a real project scenario.

## Testing Approach

### Test Environment
- Create a sample project scenario
- Test each Skill independently
- Test Skills working together
- Verify file compatibility
- Validate progressive disclosure

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Task Management
1. Create a new task using the Skill
2. Update task status
3. Create sub-tasks
4. Document a bug fix
5. Create retroactive documentation

#### Scenario 2: Planning
1. Create a new PLAN.md
2. Add feature documents
3. Perform scope validation
4. Update project context

#### Scenario 3: QA
1. Report a bug
2. Track bug through lifecycle
3. Generate quality metrics
4. Document retroactive fix

#### Scenario 4: Cross-IDE Compatibility
1. Verify files created by Claude work in Cursor
2. Verify Cursor files work with Claude Skills
3. Test concurrent usage
4. Validate no conflicts

## Acceptance Criteria

### Skill Activation
- [ ] Skills activate on relevant user requests
- [ ] Skills don't activate unnecessarily
- [ ] Activation is natural and intuitive

### Reference Material Access
- [ ] Skills can reference documentation when needed
- [ ] Reference materials provide value
- [ ] Progressive disclosure works correctly

### Example Usage
- [ ] Examples can be copied as templates
- [ ] Examples demonstrate best practices
- [ ] Examples are realistic and useful

### File Compatibility
- [ ] Files created match Cursor format exactly
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is valid
- [ ] Markdown formatting is correct
- [ ] No conflicts between IDEs

### User Experience
- [ ] Skills provide clear guidance
- [ ] Workflows are intuitive
- [ ] Documentation is accessible
- [ ] Error handling is graceful

## Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Individual Skill Testing (Current)
1. Test fstrent-task-management Skill
2. Test fstrent-planning Skill
3. Test fstrent-qa Skill

### Phase 2: Integration Testing
1. Test Skills working together
2. Test cross-references between files
3. Test workflow transitions

### Phase 3: Compatibility Testing
1. Create files with Claude, verify in Cursor
2. Create files with Cursor, verify with Claude
3. Test concurrent editing

### Phase 4: Documentation Review
1. Verify all reference materials are accessible
2. Test example file usage
3. Validate documentation accuracy
