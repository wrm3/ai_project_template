# Task 009: Integration Testing Across Both IDEs

## Objective
Comprehensively test that all `fstrent_spec_tasks` components (Skills, Commands, Agent) work together seamlessly in both Claude Code and Cursor, with special focus on cross-IDE file sharing and compatibility.

## Background
We have:
- ✅ 3 comprehensive Skills (Task Management, Planning, QA)
- ✅ 7 custom commands
- ✅ 1 subagent (task-expander)
- ✅ Complete documentation
- ✅ Reference materials and examples

Now we need to verify they all work together and are 100% compatible across both IDEs.

## Testing Scope

### Component Integration
1. **Skills ↔ Commands**: Commands invoke Skills correctly
2. **Skills ↔ Agent**: Agent uses Skills for task creation
3. **Commands ↔ Agent**: Commands can trigger agent
4. **All Together**: Complete workflows using all components

### Cross-IDE Compatibility
1. **File Format**: Files created in one IDE work in the other
2. **Concurrent Usage**: Both IDEs can work on same project
3. **File Sharing**: Changes sync properly
4. **No Conflicts**: No IDE-specific issues

### End-to-End Workflows
1. **New Project Setup**: Start planning → Create tasks → Track progress
2. **Feature Development**: Plan feature → Create tasks → Implement → Test
3. **Bug Management**: Report bug → Create fix task → Track → Resolve
4. **Quality Review**: Generate metrics → Analyze → Improve
