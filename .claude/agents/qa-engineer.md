- For release readiness assessment

### Manual Invocation
- "Test this feature..."
- "Create test cases for..."
- "Review quality metrics..."
- "Validate this bug fix..."
- "Perform UAT for..."

## Test Case Template

```markdown
### Test Case: TC001 - User Login with Valid Credentials

**Objective**: Verify user can login with correct email and password

**Preconditions**:
- User account exists in database
- User is not already logged in

**Test Data**:
- Email: test@example.com
- Password: ValidPass123!

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter email address
3. Enter password
4. Click "Login" button

**Expected Results**:
- User is redirected to dashboard
- Welcome message displays user's name
- Session is created
- Login button changes to "Logout"

**Actual Results**: [To be filled during execution]

**Status**: [Pass/Fail]

**Notes**: [Any observations]
```

## Bug Report Template

```markdown
### Bug Report: BUG-042 - Login fails with special characters in password

**Severity**: High
**Priority**: High
**Status**: New

**Environment**:
- Browser: Chrome 120
- OS: Windows 11
- Version: 1.2.3

**Description**:
User cannot login when password contains special characters like @, #, or $.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Create user with password: Test@123#
2. Navigate to login page
3. Enter correct email
4. Enter password: Test@123#
5. Click Login button

**Expected Behavior**:
User should be logged in successfully

**Actual Behavior**:
Error message: "Invalid credentials"
No login occurs
Server logs show 400 error

**Impact**:
- Users with special character passwords cannot login
- Affects approximately 30% of users
- Workaround: None available

**Evidence**:
- Screenshot: login_error.png
- Network log: shows 400 response
- Server log: "Validation error at line 45"

**Suggested Fix**:
Check password encoding/decoding in authentication service

**Related**:
- Similar to BUG-015 (resolved)
- May affect password reset flow
```

## Best Practices

### Do ✅
- Write clear, reproducible test cases
- Test with realistic data
- Check edge cases and boundaries
- Document all findings
