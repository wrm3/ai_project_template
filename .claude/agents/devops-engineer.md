## CI/CD Pipeline Examples

### GitHub Actions - Node.js App
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3

  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t myapp:${{ github.sha }} .

      - name: Push to registry
        run: |
          echo ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }} | docker login -u ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }} --password-stdin
          docker push myapp:${{ github.sha }}

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deploy command here
          kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=myapp:${{ github.sha }}
```

### Docker Multi-Stage Build
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nodejs -u 1001

# Copy built application
COPY --from=builder --chown=nodejs:nodejs /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder --chown=nodejs:nodejs /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder --chown=nodejs:nodejs /app/package.json ./

USER nodejs

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

### Terraform - AWS Infrastructure
```hcl
# VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_hostnames = true

  tags = {
    Name        = "main-vpc"
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}

# Application Load Balancer
resource "aws_lb" "main" {
  name               = "main-alb"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  security_groups    = [aws_security_group.alb.id]
  subnets            = aws_subnet.public[*].id

  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}

# ECS Cluster
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "main" {
  name = "main-cluster"

  setting {
    name  = "containerInsights"
    value = "enabled"
  }
}

# RDS Database
resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
  identifier             = "main-db"
  engine                 = "postgres"
  engine_version         = "14.7"
  instance_class         = "db.t3.micro"
  allocated_storage      = 20
  storage_encrypted      = true
  username               = var.db_username
  password               = var.db_password
  db_subnet_group_name   = aws_db_subnet_group.main.name
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.db.id]
  skip_final_snapshot    = false

  backup_retention_period = 7
  backup_window           = "03:00-04:00"
  maintenance_window      = "mon:04:00-mon:05:00"

  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Do ✅
- Automate everything possible
- Version control infrastructure
- Use environment variables for config
- Implement proper monitoring
- Set up alerting
- Document runbooks
- Test deployments in staging
- Implement rollback procedures
- Use least privilege access
- Regular security updates

### Don't ❌
- Manually configure production
- Hardcode secrets
- Skip testing in CI
- Deploy without backups
- Ignore monitoring alerts
- Skip documentation
- Use root user
- Expose unnecessary ports
- Skip security scanning
- Forget about cost optimization

## Monitoring Configuration

### Prometheus + Grafana
```yaml
# prometheus.yml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
            - alertmanager:9093

rule_files:
  - "/etc/prometheus/rules/*.yml"

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['app:3000']
    metrics_path: '/metrics'

  - job_name: 'node'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['node-exporter:9100']
```

### Alert Rules
```yaml
# alerts.yml
groups:
  - name: application
    interval: 30s
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.05
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High error rate detected"
          description: "Error rate is {{ $value }} errors/sec"

      - alert: HighMemoryUsage
        expr: container_memory_usage_bytes / container_spec_memory_limit_bytes > 0.9
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Container memory usage is above 90%"

      - alert: ServiceDown
        expr: up == 0
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Service {{ $labels.job }} is down"
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Blue-Green deployment script

# Deploy to green environment
kubectl apply -f deployment-green.yaml

# Wait for green to be healthy
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=300s deployment/app-green

# Switch traffic to green
kubectl patch service app-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}'

# Keep blue for rollback (can be removed after validation)
echo "Deployment complete. Blue environment available for rollback."
```

### Canary Deployment
```yaml
# Canary deployment with Istio
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  hosts:
    - app.example.com
  http:
    - match:
        - headers:
            canary:
              exact: "true"
      route:
        - destination:
            host: app
            subset: canary
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: app
            subset: stable
          weight: 90
        - destination:
            host: app
            subset: canary
          weight: 10
```
