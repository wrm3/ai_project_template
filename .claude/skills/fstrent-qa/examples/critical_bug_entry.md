### Bug ID: BUG-006
- **Title**: Application crashes on data save
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Source**: Production
- **Feature Impact**: Data Persistence, Core Functionality
- **Status**: Investigating
- **Task Reference**: Task 021
- **Created**: 2025-10-19 14:30 UTC
- **Assigned**: Emergency Response Team
- **Priority**: P0 - Drop Everything

**Description**:
Application crashes immediately when users attempt to save data. No error message shown, app just terminates unexpectedly. Affects 100% of users, completely blocking core functionality.

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Open application
2. Make any changes to data (add, edit, or delete)
3. Click "Save" button
4. Application crashes immediately

**Expected Behavior**:
- Data should be saved successfully
- User should see confirmation message
- Application should remain stable

**Actual Behavior**:
- Application terminates unexpectedly
- No error message displayed
- Data is lost
- User must restart application

**Environment**:
- **Platforms**: All (Windows 11, macOS 14, Linux)
- **Browsers**: All (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Version**: 2.1.0 (deployed 2025-10-19 14:00 UTC)
- **Previous Version**: 2.0.5 (worked correctly)
- **Deployment**: Production
- **Impact**: 100% of users affected

**User Impact**:
- **Severity**: Complete loss of core functionality
- **Users Affected**: All active users (~500)
- **Business Impact**: Critical - users cannot save work
- **Revenue Impact**: High - blocking all transactions
- **Support Tickets**: 47 tickets in 30 minutes
- **Social Media**: Negative feedback increasing

**Investigation Status**:

**14:35 UTC - Initial Response**:
- Emergency response team activated
- Production deployment halted
- Monitoring dashboards reviewed
- Error logs being analyzed

**14:40 UTC - Error Log Analysis**:
- Found exception in save operation: `NullReferenceException`
- Stack trace points to data validation module
- Appears related to recent deployment (2.1.0)

**14:45 UTC - Code Review**:
- Reviewing changes in version 2.1.0
- Identified new validation logic added in commit def456
- Validation attempting to access property that may be null
- Root cause likely identified

**14:50 UTC - Fix Development**:
- Null check added to validation logic
- Unit test created to prevent recurrence
- Code review in progress
- Preparing hotfix deployment

**Root Cause (Preliminary)**:
New data validation logic introduced in version 2.1.0 attempts to access a property without null checking. When property is null (valid scenario), application crashes.

**Proposed Fix**:
Add null check before property access in validation module. Revert to previous validation behavior for null values.

**Rollback Plan**:
- **Option 1**: Deploy hotfix (2.1.1) - Estimated 15 minutes
- **Option 2**: Rollback to 2.0.5 - Estimated 5 minutes
- **Decision**: Attempting hotfix first, rollback ready if issues

**Testing Plan**:
1. Verify fix in local environment
2. Deploy to staging
3. Run automated test suite
4. Manual verification of save operations
5. Deploy to production with monitoring

**Communication**:
- **14:35**: Status page updated - "Investigating critical issue"
- **14:40**: Email sent to all users - "Service disruption, working on fix"
- **14:45**: Social media update - "Aware of issue, fix in progress"
- **15:00**: Planned update - "Hotfix deployed" or "Rollback completed"

**Monitoring**:
- Error rate: 100% on save operations
- Active users: Declining (users giving up)
- Support tickets: Increasing rapidly
- Social media sentiment: Negative

**Stakeholders Notified**:
- ✅ CTO - 14:32 UTC
- ✅ CEO - 14:35 UTC
- ✅ Customer Support Lead - 14:33 UTC
- ✅ Product Manager - 14:34 UTC
- ✅ Marketing Lead - 14:36 UTC

**Post-Incident Actions** (Planned):
1. Deploy fix/rollback
2. Verify functionality restored
3. Monitor for 2 hours
4. Conduct post-mortem
5. Update deployment procedures
6. Add pre-deployment validation
7. Improve automated testing
8. Review code review process

**Lessons Learned** (Preliminary):
- Need better null handling in validation
- Automated tests didn't catch this scenario
- Need staging environment testing before production
- Should have gradual rollout for major changes
- Monitoring caught issue quickly (good)
- Response time was fast (good)

**Timeline**:
- **14:00 UTC**: Version 2.1.0 deployed
- **14:30 UTC**: First user reports received
- **14:32 UTC**: Bug confirmed critical
- **14:35 UTC**: Emergency response activated
- **14:45 UTC**: Root cause identified
- **14:50 UTC**: Fix in development
- **15:00 UTC**: Target deployment time

**Estimated Resolution**: 15-30 minutes from discovery

**Follow-up Tasks**:
- [ ] Deploy hotfix or rollback
- [ ] Verify fix works
- [ ] Monitor for 2 hours
- [ ] Conduct post-mortem meeting
- [ ] Update deployment checklist
- [ ] Add regression tests
- [ ] Review code review process
- [ ] Update documentation
