3. **Be Realistic**: Don't over-promise
4. **Be Complete**: Cover all sections
5. **Be Concise**: Respect the reader's time
6. **Be Clear**: Use simple language
7. **Be Visual**: Include diagrams when helpful

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too Vague**: "Improve user experience"  
✅ **Specific**: "Reduce login time from 5s to 2s"

❌ **Feature List**: Just listing features  
✅ **User-Focused**: Explaining why features matter

❌ **Technical Jargon**: "Implement microservices architecture"  
✅ **Business Value**: "Enable independent team deployment"

❌ **No Metrics**: "Make it better"  
✅ **Measurable**: "Increase conversion by 15%"
