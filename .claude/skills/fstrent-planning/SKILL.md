# fstrent Planning Skill

Create and manage comprehensive project plans, Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), and feature specifications using the fstrent_spec_tasks planning system. This Skill provides structured planning workflows that prevent over-engineering while ensuring thorough requirements gathering.

## System Overview

The fstrent_spec_tasks planning system uses:
- **PLAN.md**: `.fstrent_spec_tasks/PLAN.md` - Main Product Requirements Document

# Feature: [Feature Name]

## Overview
[Brief description of the feature]

## Requirements
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

## User Stories
- **US-001**: As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit]

- Links to bugs in BUGS.md that affect this feature
```

### Feature Naming Convention
- Lowercase with hyphens: `user-authentication.md`, `payment-processing.md`
- Descriptive and specific
- Matches feature name in PLAN.md

### Feature-Task Integration
- Tasks reference features via `feature:` field in YAML
- Feature documents list implementing tasks
- Feature completion tracked through task completion

## Scope Validation

### Mandatory Questions (Ask Before Creating PRD)

**Purpose**: Prevent over-engineering and clarify requirements

#### 1. User Context & Deployment
"Intended for personal use, small team, or broader deployment?"
- **Personal (1 user)**: Simple, file-based, minimal security
- **Small team (2-10)**: Basic sharing, simple user management
- **Broader (10+)**: Full authentication, role management, scalability

#### 2. Security Requirements
"Security expectations?"
- **Minimal**: Basic validation, no authentication
- **Standard**: User auth, session management, basic authorization
- **Enhanced**: Role-based access, encryption, audit trails
- **Enterprise**: SAML/SSO, compliance, advanced security

#### 3. Scalability Expectations
"Performance and scalability expectations?"
- **Basic**: Works for expected load, simple architecture
- **Moderate**: Handles growth, some optimization
- **High**: Speed-optimized, caching, efficient queries
- **Enterprise**: Load balancing, clustering, horizontal scaling

#### 4. Feature Complexity
"How much complexity comfortable with?"
- **Minimal**: Core functionality, keep simple
- **Standard**: Core plus reasonable conveniences
- **Feature-Rich**: Comprehensive with advanced options
- **Enterprise**: Full-featured with extensive configuration

#### 5. Integration Requirements
"Integration needs?"
- **Standalone**: No external integrations
- **Basic**: File import/export, basic API
- **Standard**: REST API, webhooks, common integrations
- **Enterprise**: Comprehensive API, message queues, enterprise systems

### Over-Engineering Prevention Rules

**Apply these defaults unless explicitly requested:**
- **Authentication**: Don't add role permissions unless requested
- **Database**: Use simple file-based unless DB explicitly requested
- **API**: Don't add comprehensive REST beyond required
- **Architecture**: Default monolith unless scale requires separation

## Codebase Analysis (Existing Projects)

### When to Use
When initializing fstrent_spec_tasks in existing projects with code

### Analysis Process

1. **File Structure Analysis**
   - Identify main components and modules
   - Determine project organization patterns
   - Map directory structure to functionality

2. **Dependency Mapping**
   - Map relationships between components
   - Identify external dependencies
   - Document integration points

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Identify features from code patterns
   - Determine feature boundaries
   - Group related functionality

4. **Subsystem Identification**
   - Group related functionality into subsystems
   - Define subsystem boundaries
   - Document subsystem responsibilities

5. **Integration Discovery**
   - Find external system connections
   - Identify APIs and services used
   - Document data flows

### Analysis Outputs
- Generate PLAN.md based on current code structure
- Create feature documents for each major component
- Identify subsystems from code organization
- Document current architecture and integration points

## Planning Operations

- **Dependencies**: Core task management feature
- **Integration Points**: Task creation, task storage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can set recurrence pattern when creating task
- [ ] New task instances created automatically
- [ ] User can complete individual instances
- [ ] User can edit or delete entire series
- [ ] Recurrence data persisted correctly

## Related Tasks
- Task to implement recurrence UI

- Task to update persistence layer
```

3. Update PLAN.md section 4.1:
```markdown
- **Recurring Tasks** (Priority: Medium)
  - Create tasks with recurrence patterns
  - Automatic task instance creation
  - Manage recurring series
```

4. Confirm: "Added Recurring Tasks feature to plan"

## Compatibility Notes

This Skill works with the same file format used by Cursor's fstrent_spec_tasks planning system. Plans and features created in Claude Code can be viewed and updated in Cursor, and vice versa. The system uses:

- Standard markdown format
- Consistent section structure
- Git-friendly plain text files
- Cross-IDE compatible templates

Teams can use both IDEs interchangeably for planning activities.
