# Feature: User Authentication

## Overview
Secure authentication system allowing users to register, login, and manage their accounts. Provides the foundation for user-specific features and data protection.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Users can register with email and password
- Users can login with valid credentials
- Users can logout from their session
- Users can reset forgotten passwords
- Sessions persist across browser sessions
- Sessions expire after 24 hours of inactivity

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Password hashing using bcrypt (min 10 rounds)
- JWT tokens for session management
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- HTTPS required for all auth operations
- OWASP authentication best practices followed

## User Stories

### US-001: User Registration
**As a** new user  
**I want to** create an account with email and password  
**So that** I can access personalized features

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Email validation (valid format, unique)
- Password requirements (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number)
- Confirmation email sent
- Account created in database
- User redirected to onboarding

### US-002: User Login
**As a** registered user  
**I want to** login with my credentials  
**So that** I can access my account

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Login with email and password
- Invalid credentials show error message
- Successful login creates session
- User redirected to dashboard
- "Remember me" option available

### US-003: Password Reset
**As a** user who forgot password  
**I want to** reset my password via email  
**So that** I can regain access to my account

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Request reset via email
- Receive reset link (expires in 1 hour)
- Set new password
- Old password no longer works
- Confirmation email sent

### US-004: Logout
**As a** logged-in user  
**I want to** logout from my session  
**So that** I can secure my account

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Logout button accessible
- Session invalidated on logout
- User redirected to homepage
- Cannot access protected pages after logout

## Technical Considerations

### Subsystems Affected
- **Authentication Service**: Core auth logic
- **Database**: User table, session storage
- **API**: Auth endpoints (/register, /login, /logout, /reset)
- **Frontend**: Login/register forms, session management
- **Email Service**: Password reset, confirmation emails

### Dependencies
- bcrypt library for password hashing
- jsonwebtoken library for JWT
- Email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, or similar)
- Redis for session storage (optional, recommended)

### Integration Points
- All protected API endpoints check authentication
- Frontend checks session before rendering protected pages
- User profile features depend on authentication
- Analytics track authenticated vs anonymous users

### Security Considerations
- Passwords never stored in plain text
- JWT tokens include expiration
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- CSRF protection on auth endpoints
- Secure cookie flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)

### Performance Considerations
- Session validation on every request (must be fast)
- Consider Redis for session storage (< 10ms lookup)
- Password hashing is intentionally slow (security vs UX)
- Cache user permissions to avoid DB lookups

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature Complete When:
- [ ] All user stories implemented
- [ ] Unit tests pass (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] QA approval received

### Specific Metrics:
- Login response time < 500ms
- Registration response time < 1 second
- Password reset email delivered < 30 seconds
- Zero security vulnerabilities in scan
- 99.9% uptime for auth service

- Feature: Social Login (enhances auth)

## Design Mockups

### Registration Flow
```
[Homepage] → [Register Button] → [Registration Form]
  ↓
[Email Confirmation] → [Welcome Email] → [Dashboard]
```

### Login Flow
```
[Homepage] → [Login Button] → [Login Form]
  ↓
[Validate Credentials] → [Create Session] → [Dashboard]
```

### Password Reset Flow
```
[Login Page] → [Forgot Password] → [Email Form]
  ↓
[Reset Email] → [Reset Link] → [New Password Form]
  ↓
[Confirmation] → [Login Page]
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Password hashing/verification
- JWT token generation/validation
- Email validation logic
- Rate limiting logic

### Integration Tests
- Complete registration flow
- Complete login flow
- Complete password reset flow
- Session expiration
- Invalid credentials handling

### Security Tests
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attempts
- CSRF attacks
- Brute force protection
- Session hijacking prevention

### Performance Tests
- 100 concurrent logins
- 1000 session validations/second
- Password hashing under load

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Internal Testing (Week 1)
- Deploy to staging
- Internal team testing
- Security review
- Performance testing

### Phase 2: Beta Release (Week 2)
- Invite 50 beta users
- Monitor for issues
- Gather feedback
- Fix critical bugs

### Phase 3: Full Release (Week 3)
- Deploy to production
- Monitor closely for 48 hours
- Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
- Rollback plan ready

## Success Metrics

### Launch Metrics (First 30 Days)
- Registration conversion rate > 20%
- Login success rate > 95%
- Password reset completion rate > 80%
- Zero security incidents
- Average login time < 500ms

### Long-Term Metrics (90 Days)
- User retention > 60%
- Session duration > 15 minutes
- Return user rate > 40%
- Support tickets < 5% of users

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Security vulnerabilities (Mitigation: Security audit, penetration testing)
- Performance issues under load (Mitigation: Load testing, Redis caching)

### Medium Risk
- Email delivery failures (Mitigation: Multiple email providers, retry logic)
- Session management bugs (Mitigation: Thorough testing, gradual rollout)

### Low Risk
- UI/UX issues (Mitigation: User testing, iterative improvements)

## Documentation

### User Documentation
- How to register
- How to login
- How to reset password
- Security best practices

### Developer Documentation
- API endpoints specification
- Authentication flow diagrams
- Integration guide
- Security guidelines

### Operations Documentation
- Deployment procedures
- Monitoring setup
- Incident response
- Backup procedures

## Notes

- Authentication is foundational - must be rock solid
- Security is paramount - no shortcuts
- Performance matters - users expect instant login
- User experience is critical - make it smooth
- Plan for scale - design for 10x current needs
