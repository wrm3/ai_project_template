# Task 1: Implement User Authentication

## Objective
Create a secure authentication system allowing users to register, login, and manage their sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can register with email and password
- [ ] Users can login with valid credentials
- [ ] Sessions are managed securely with JWT tokens
- [ ] Password reset functionality works
- [ ] Tests cover all authentication flows
- [ ] API documentation updated

## Implementation Notes
- Use bcrypt for password hashing (min 10 rounds)
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Implement rate limiting on login endpoint (5 attempts per minute)
- Follow OWASP authentication best practices

## Testing Plan
1. Test successful registration flow
2. Test login with valid/invalid credentials
3. Test session expiration
4. Test password reset flow
5. Security testing for common vulnerabilities
