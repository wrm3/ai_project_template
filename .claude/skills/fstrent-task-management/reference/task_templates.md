2. Test login with valid/invalid credentials
3. Test session expiration
4. Test password reset flow
5. Security testing for common vulnerabilities

## Resource Requirements

id: 15
title: '[BUG] Login button not responding to clicks'
type: bug_fix
status: in-progress
priority: critical
feature: User Authentication
subsystems: [frontend, authentication]
project_context: 'Resolves critical login issue affecting all users, maintaining user access capability'
bug_reference: BUG-001
severity: critical
source: production

# Task 15: [BUG] Login Button Not Responding

## Objective
Fix critical bug preventing users from accessing login functionality.

## Bug Details
**Bug Reference**: BUG-001
**Severity**: Critical
**Source**: Production
**Environment**: All browsers, Windows 11, macOS

## Reproduction Steps
1. Navigate to homepage (https://app.example.com)
2. Click "Login" button in top-right corner
3. Observe no response
**Result**: Button appears clickable but nothing happens

## Expected vs Actual Behavior
**Expected**: Login modal should appear with email/password fields
**Actual**: Button click has no visual or functional effect

## Root Cause Analysis
Event listener was removed during refactoring in commit abc123. The button element exists but has no click handler attached.

## Fix Implementation
1. Restore click event listener in `auth.js`
2. Add unit test to verify listener is attached
3. Add integration test for login flow

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login button responds to clicks
- [ ] Login modal appears correctly
- [ ] Unit test confirms event listener present
- [ ] Integration test covers full login flow
- [ ] Fix verified in production

## Testing Plan
- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Test on Windows, macOS, Linux
- Test on mobile devices
- Verify no console errors
- Check analytics for successful logins

## Related Issues
- Related to refactoring in Task 12
```

# Task 16: [RETROACTIVE] Database Query Performance

## Objective
Document the database query optimization completed during chat debugging session.

## What Was Fixed
User search queries were taking 5+ seconds to complete, causing timeouts and poor user experience. The issue affected all search operations across the application.

## Solution Implemented
1. Added composite index on (last_name, first_name, email)
2. Rewrote query to use index-friendly WHERE clauses
3. Implemented query result caching for common searches
4. Added query performance monitoring

## Files Changed
- `database/migrations/add_user_search_index.sql`
- `api/services/user_search.py`
- `api/utils/cache.py`
- `tests/test_user_search.py`

## Impact
- Query time reduced from 5s to 0.2s (96% improvement)
- User search now instant and responsive
- Reduced database load by 80%
- Improved overall application performance

## Lessons Learned
- Always profile queries before optimization
- Composite indexes are powerful for multi-column searches
- Caching common queries significantly reduces load
- Monitor query performance in production

## Testing Performed
- Benchmarked query performance before/after
- Tested with 100,000 user records
- Verified cache invalidation works correctly
- Load tested with concurrent searches

## Documentation Updated
- Added performance optimization guide
- Updated API documentation with caching behavior
- Documented index maintenance procedures
```
