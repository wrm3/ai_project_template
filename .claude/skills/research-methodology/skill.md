## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Over-Researching
**Problem**: Spending excessive time on research, paralysis by analysis

**Solution**: Set time limits, define "good enough", focus on decision-making

### Single-Source Bias
**Problem**: Relying on one source, missing alternative perspectives

**Solution**: Always consult multiple sources, cross-verify claims

### Outdated Information
**Problem**: Using obsolete information, deprecated approaches

**Solution**: Check publication dates, prioritize recent content

### Poor Source Evaluation
**Problem**: Treating all sources as equally credible

**Solution**: Use source quality tiers, prioritize authoritative sources

### Lack of Synthesis
**Problem**: Just listing findings without analysis

**Solution**: Organize by themes, identify patterns, provide insights

### Missing Citations
**Problem**: Not documenting sources, can't verify claims

**Solution**: Cite all sources, include URLs and dates

### Scope Creep
**Problem**: Research expands beyond original question

**Solution**: Regularly check against research objective, stay focused

### No Actionable Output
**Problem**: Research doesn't inform decision or action

**Solution**: Always end with clear recommendations and next steps

## Research Workflow Examples

### Example: User asks "What's the best way to handle authentication in my Next.js app?"

**Step 1: Define objective**
Research authentication solutions for Next.js applications, compare options, recommend best approach for user's use case.

**Step 2: Broad search**
```
WebSearch: "Next.js authentication best practices 2025"
Goal: Overview of current approaches
```

**Step 3: Identify key options**
From initial search, identify main approaches:
- NextAuth.js
- Auth0
- Clerk
- Supabase Auth
- Custom JWT implementation

**Step 4: Deep dive on each**
Use WebFetch to read:
- Official documentation for each
- Comparison articles
- Implementation examples

**Step 5: Create comparison matrix**
| Solution | Pros | Cons | Use Cases | Cost |
|----------|------|------|-----------|------|
| NextAuth.js | Free, flexible, self-hosted | Setup complexity | Full control needed | Free |
| Auth0 | Feature-rich, easy setup | Expensive at scale | Enterprise apps | Paid tiers |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Step 6: Provide recommendation**
Based on user's context (if known):
- Startup/small app → NextAuth.js or Clerk
- Enterprise → Auth0 or Okta
- Simple use case → Supabase Auth

**Step 7: Document findings**
Save to `docs/research/nextjs-authentication-comparison.md`

**Step 8: Provide actionable response**
"Based on comprehensive research, here are the main authentication options for Next.js, with recommendations based on your use case..."
