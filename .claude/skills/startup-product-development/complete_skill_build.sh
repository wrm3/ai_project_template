# Biotech/Pharma Development Guide
> R&D to FDA approval for diagnostics, devices, and therapeutics

## Development Phases
### Discovery (Year 1)
- Literature review, hypothesis generation
- Target identification
- Assay development
- Proof of concept data

### Preclinical (Year 1-2)
- In vitro validation
- Animal studies (if therapeutic)
- Safety/toxicity testing
- Manufacturing process development

### Clinical Trials (Year 2-4)
- Phase I: Safety (20-80 patients)
- Phase II: Efficacy (100-300 patients)
- Phase III: Confirmation (1000+ patients)

### FDA Submission (Year 3-5)
- 510(k) for Class II devices (substantial equivalence)
- PMA for Class III devices (new/high risk)
- IND/NDA for therapeutics

### Manufacturing (Year 4-6)
- GMP facility qualification
- Process validation
- Quality systems (ISO 13485)

## Regulatory Pathways
### Medical Devices
**510(k) Clearance**: $5K-50K, 3-12 months
**De Novo**: $50K-200K, 12-18 months
**PMA**: $200K-500K+, 1-3 years

### Diagnostics

## Clinical Trial Design
**Endpoints**: Primary (efficacy), Secondary (safety, QoL)
**Blinding**: Single-blind, double-blind, open-label
**Controls**: Placebo, active comparator, historical
**Statistical Power**: 80%+ power to detect effect

**Example**: Diagnostic test validation
- N=200-500 samples

- Cost: $100K-500K

## IP Strategy
**Patent Claims**:
- Composition of matter
- Method of use

# Quality Assurance Frameworks
> Testing strategies and QA processes by industry

## Software/SaaS QA

## QA Process

### Test Planning
1. Define test strategy
2. Identify test cases
3. Estimate effort
4. Assign resources

### Test Execution
1. Execute test cases
2. Log defects
3. Verify fixes
4. Regression testing

### Release Criteria
- All critical bugs fixed

# Revolutionary Concept Exploration Guide
> First principles thinking and moonshot validation

## Innovation Frameworks

### First Principles Thinking
**Process**:
1. Identify the problem
2. Break down into fundamental truths
3. Question every assumption
4. Rebuild solution from ground up

**Example: Tesla/SpaceX**
- Traditional: Rockets must be expendable
- First Principles: Physics doesn't require it
- Solution: Reusable rockets (10x cost reduction)

### Design Thinking
**5 Stages**:
1. **Empathize**: Deep understanding of user needs
2. **Define**: Clear problem statement
3. **Ideate**: Brainstorm solutions
4. **Prototype**: Quick mockups
5. **Test**: Validate with users

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks per cycle

### TRIZ (40 Inventive Principles)
- Segmentation: Divide into parts
- Taking out: Remove troublesome part
- Local quality: Make each part optimal
- Asymmetry: Change from symmetric to asymmetric
- Consolidation: Combine identical functions
- [35 more principles...]

**Used by**: Samsung, Intel, NASA, Boeing

### Jobs-to-be-Done Framework
**Question**: What "job" is the customer hiring your product to do?

**Example**:
- Milkshake sales: Not nutrition, but entertainment during commute
- Insight: Make thicker (lasts longer), add fruit chunks

## Moonshot Validation

### Technical Feasibility Assessment
**Questions**:
- Can it be built with existing technology?
- If not, what breakthrough is needed?
- Timeline for that breakthrough?
- Can we afford to wait?

**Risk Levels**:
- **Low Risk**: Existing tech, proven components
- **Medium Risk**: Emerging tech, some uncertainty
- **High Risk**: Requires fundamental breakthrough

### Market Validation
**Must Answer**:
- Do people actually need this?
- Will they pay for it?
- How large is the market?
- Can we reach them?

**Validation Methods**:
- User interviews (50-100 minimum)
- Landing page with signup (measure interest)
- Prototype testing
- Crowdfunding campaign (Kickstarter)

### Business Model Validation
**Questions**:
- How will we make money?
- What are unit economics?
- Can it scale profitably?
- What's the competitive moat?

### Competitive Moat Assessment
**Moat Types**:
- Patents/IP
- Network effects
- Brand/reputation
- Switching costs
- Cost advantages (scale, process)

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

### PoC vs MVP vs Prototype
**PoC**: Proves technical feasibility (often ugly)
**Prototype**: Demonstrates look and feel (may not work)
**MVP**: Minimum VIABLE product (works, delivers value)

### PoC Development
**Goal**: Validate core hypothesis

**Timeline**: 2-8 weeks

**Deliverables**:
- Working demo of core technology
- Performance data
- Feasibility report
- Go/no-go recommendation

**Example**: AI-powered diagnostic
- PoC: Algorithm achieves 90%+ accuracy on test set
- Data: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, performance metrics
- Outcome: Proceed to clinical validation

## Innovation Metrics

### Leading Indicators
- Number of experiments run
- Ideas generated per week
- Prototype iterations
- User testing sessions

### Lagging Indicators
- Patents filed
- New products launched
- Revenue from new products
- Market share in new categories

## Pivot Framework

### When to Pivot
**Signals**:
- Consistent user feedback shows wrong problem
- Unable to achieve product-market fit after 6-12 months
- Market dynamics changed
- Better opportunity identified

**Types of Pivots**:
- **Zoom-in**: Single feature becomes the product
- **Zoom-out**: Product becomes single feature of larger product
- **Customer Segment**: Serve different customer
- **Platform**: Product → Platform or vice versa
- **Business Model**: Change how you make money

### When to Persevere
**Signals**:
- Strong early adopter engagement
- Improving metrics (retention, NPS)
- Clear path to product-market fit
- Positive unit economics
