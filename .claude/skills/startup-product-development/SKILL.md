## When to Use This Skill

### Automatic Triggers
Use this skill automatically when user mentions:
- "product roadmap"
- "MVP" or "minimum viable product"
- "product development plan"
- "technology stack"
- "what should I build first"
- "product-market fit"
- "revolutionary product"
- Industry-specific: "prototype", "clinical trials", "manufacturing"

### Manual Invocation
- User explicitly asks for product development guidance
- User needs help defining MVP scope
- User wants to create a product roadmap
- User needs technology stack recommendations
- User is exploring revolutionary concepts

### NOT for This Skill
- Code implementation (use full-stack-developer, backend-developer, frontend-developer SubAgents)
- Bug fixing (use debugger SubAgent)
- Code review (use code-reviewer SubAgent)
- Infrastructure setup (use devops-engineer SubAgent)

## Core Capabilities

### 1. MVP Definition

**Purpose**: Define the absolute minimum product that delivers core value

**Process**:
1. Identify core problem being solved

**Buy/Use Third-Party When**:
- Commodity functionality (auth, payments, email)
- Well-established market solutions exist
- Faster time to market critical
- Not core to competitive advantage
- Ongoing maintenance burden too high

**Decision Matrix**:
| Factor | Weight | Build Score | Buy Score |
|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Time to Market | 0.25 | 3/10 | 9/10 |
| Cost (2 years) | 0.20 | 5/10 | 7/10 |
| Competitive Advantage | 0.25 | 9/10 | 2/10 |
| Maintenance Burden | 0.15 | 4/10 | 8/10 |
| Flexibility/Control | 0.15 | 10/10 | 5/10 |
| **Weighted Total** | **1.00** | **6.3/10** | **6.4/10** |

**Common Buy Decisions for Startups**:
- Authentication: Auth0, Firebase Auth, AWS Cognito
- Payments: Stripe, PayPal, Square
- Email: SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES

- Focus on product-market fit before scaling

### DON'T:
- Build for scale before validation
- Choose trendy tech without justification
- Skip testing to save time
- Add features without user validation
- Ignore technical debt indefinitely
- Neglect regulatory requirements (hardware, biotech)
- Build commodity features (auth, payments)
- Perfect UI before validating core value
- Commit to long roadmap without flexibility

## Industry-Specific Gotchas

### Software/SaaS
- **Avoid**: Over-engineering for scale on day 1
- **Do**: Use managed services (AWS, Firebase) to move fast
- **Watch out for**: Security vulnerabilities, GDPR compliance

### Hardware
- **Avoid**: Skipping certifications (FCC, CE) until production
- **Do**: Plan for manufacturing from prototype stage
- **Watch out for**: Component lead times (can be 6+ months), supply chain disruptions

### Biotech
- **Avoid**: Underestimating regulatory timeline (add 50%)
- **Do**: Engage FDA early for pre-submission meetings
- **Watch out for**: Clinical trial recruitment, reimbursement pathway

### Consumer Products
- **Avoid**: Assuming "if you build it, they will come"
- **Do**: Validate demand before manufacturing MOQ
- **Watch out for**: Retail margins (need 3-5x manufacturing cost)

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: MVP keeps growing in scope
**Solution**: Use MoSCoW prioritization - move everything except "Must Have" to post-MVP roadmap

### Problem: Can't decide on technology stack
**Solution**: Use `templates/tech_stack_decision_matrix.xlsx` with weighted criteria, bias toward team expertise

### Problem: Product roadmap too ambitious
**Solution**: Apply RICE scoring, cut bottom 50% of features, focus on quarterly themes

### Problem: How do I know if I have product-market fit?
**Solution**: Measure retention cohorts, NPS, Sean Ellis test (>40% "very disappointed" if product disappeared)

### Problem: Build vs buy decision paralysis
**Solution**: Use `templates/build_vs_buy_template.xlsx`, default to "buy" unless core competitive differentiator
