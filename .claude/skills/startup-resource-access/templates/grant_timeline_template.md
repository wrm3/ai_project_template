## Common Timeline Mistakes

**Don't**:
- Start 2 weeks before deadline (need 3+ months)
- Forget program officer contact (do early)
- Skip preliminary data (weakens proposal)
- Ignore reviewer comments (if resubmitting)
- Apply to wrong agency/topic (poor fit)
- Submit on deadline day (technical issues common)

**Do**:
- Start 3-4 months early
- Contact program officer in month 1
- Collect preliminary data throughout
- Apply to multiple agencies (increase odds)
- Submit 2-3 days early (avoid last-minute issues)
- Get external review before submission
