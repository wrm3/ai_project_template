# Startup Resource Access Skill

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for accessing startup resources across ALL industries:
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure credits - $350k+)
- Lab space and equipment (BioLabs, JLABS, QB3)
- Manufacturing partners (China, Mexico, USA sourcing)
- Grant programs (SBIR, STTR, NSF - $1.8M+)
- Accelerators and incubators (YC, Techstars, industry-specific)
- University resources (tech transfer, core facilities, student talent)
- Facilities and coworking

## What This Skill Covers

**For Tech Startups**: Cloud infrastructure programs worth $350k in credits
**For Biotech Startups**: Lab space access and equipment sharing
**For Hardware Startups**: Manufacturing partners and quality control
**For All Startups**: Non-dilutive grant funding ($50k-$1.8M+)

## Quick Start

### Tech Startup
1. Apply for cloud credits (AWS + GCP + Azure)
2. Research grant programs (NSF I-Corps, NSF SBIR)
3. Consider accelerators if appropriate stage

### Biotech Startup  
1. Research lab spaces (BioLabs, JLABS, QB3)
2. Visit 3-5 facilities
3. Apply for NIH SBIR grants
4. Consider IndieBio or Rock Health accelerators

### Hardware Startup
1. Join makerspace for prototyping
2. Source manufacturers (Alibaba, Thomasnet)
3. Order samples and vet suppliers
4. Consider HAX accelerator

### Physical Product Startup
1. Define manufacturing requirements
2. Request quotes from 10+ manufacturers
3. Order samples and test quality
4. Visit factories before large orders

## Key Resources

**Total Non-Dilutive Available**: $2M+
- Cloud credits: $350k
- Lab space savings: $50k-$200k/year
- SBIR grants: $1.8M+ over 2-3 years
- Manufacturing savings: 50-70% (China vs. US)

**Impact**:
- Save 15-20% equity dilution
- Extend runway by 12-24 months
- Access world-class facilities and mentorship

## Usage Examples

### Find Relevant Grants
```bash
python scripts/grant_finder.py biotech seed
```

### Match to Accelerators
```bash
python scripts/accelerator_matcher.py hardware
```

### Calculate Resource Costs
```bash
python scripts/resource_calculator.py seed
```

### Plan Resource Acquisition Timeline
```bash
python scripts/timeline_planner.py seed biotech
```

- Hardware (manufacturing, HAX accelerator)
- Energy (DOE grants, cleantech resources)
- Consumer products (manufacturing, sourcing)
- All industries (grants, accelerators, facilities)

## Success Metrics

**Resource Access Goals**:
- Cloud credits: $350k+ secured
- Lab space: Secured within 2 months of need
- Manufacturing: 3+ suppliers vetted, samples tested
- Grants: 2+ applications per year
- Non-dilutive funding: $50k+ Year 1, $1M+ by Year 3

**Efficiency Metrics**:
- Time to resource access: <3 months
- Cost savings: 60-80% vs. building own
- Non-dilutive ratio: >20% of total funding
- Runway extension: +12-24 months

## Common Use Cases

1. **Cloud Infrastructure Setup**: Apply for $350k in cloud credits
2. **Lab Space Search**: Find and secure biotech lab space
3. **Manufacturing Sourcing**: Vet manufacturers and ensure quality
4. **Grant Applications**: Write SBIR/STTR proposals
5. **Accelerator Applications**: Match to programs and apply
6. **Cost Optimization**: Maximize non-dilutive resources
