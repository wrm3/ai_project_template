# Delaware C-Corp Formation Guide

## Why Delaware?

### The Delaware Advantage

Delaware has been the corporate law gold standard for over 100 years. Over 65% of Fortune 500 companies and 90% of VC-backed startups incorporate in Delaware.

**Key Advantages**:

1. **Court of Chancery**: Specialized business court with:
   - Judges (not juries) with deep corporate law expertise
   - 200+ years of case law precedent
   - Fast resolution of corporate disputes
   - Predictable outcomes based on extensive precedent

2. **Flexible Corporate Law**: Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) allows:
   - Multiple stock classes with different rights
   - Broad indemnification of directors/officers
   - Easy amendment of corporate documents
   - Protection for board business judgment

3. **Privacy**: Delaware provides more privacy than most states:
   - Don't need to list directors/officers in public filing
   - Annual report doesn't require disclosure of business details
   - Stockholder lists not publicly searchable

4. **VC/Investor Expectation**: Investors require Delaware incorporation:
   - Standard across all VC funds
   - Familiar legal framework
   - Converting from another state is expensive and time-consuming
   - Non-Delaware incorporation is red flag to investors

5. **Efficiency**: Delaware's Division of Corporations is:
   - Highly efficient and responsive
   - Same-day processing available
   - Online filing system
   - Dedicated staff for corporate filings

**Disadvantages**:

1. **Dual State Compliance**: If operating in another state, you need to:
   - Maintain Delaware registration (annual report, franchise tax)
   - Foreign qualify in home state (additional fees, reports)
   - Pay for two registered agents
   - File in two states

2. **Franchise Tax**: Delaware charges annual franchise tax:
   - Minimum $450/year
   - Can be higher based on shares/assets
   - Due June 1 each year
   - Penalty for late payment

3. **No State Tax Benefit**: Despite myth, Delaware incorporation doesn't reduce taxes:
   - Pay state income tax where you do business (not where incorporated)
   - Delaware only avoids tax if all business is outside Delaware
   - Most startups pay tax in home state anyway

**Bottom Line**: Use Delaware if you plan to raise VC funding (non-negotiable). Consider home state if bootstrapping indefinitely.

## Formation Process Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Choose Company Name

**Requirements**:
- Must include "Corporation", "Incorporated", "Company", "Limited" or abbreviation (Corp., Inc., Co., Ltd.)
- Cannot be confusingly similar to existing Delaware corporation
- Cannot imply government affiliation or certain regulated businesses

**Check Availability**:
1. Search Delaware Division of Corporations database: https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/eCorp/EntitySearch/
2. Search USPTO for trademark conflicts: https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/
3. Check domain name availability
4. Google search for existing business usage

**Name Reservation** (optional):
- Cost: $75
- Duration: 120 days
- File Form "Application for Reservation of Name"
- Only needed if delay between name search and incorporation

**Naming Tips**:
- Choose brandable, short name
- Avoid geographic limitations ("California Tech Inc" limits expansion)
- Avoid descriptive limitations ("iPhone App Corp" limits pivot)
- Check for .com domain availability
- Ensure name is trademarkable

**Common Mistakes**:
- Choosing name that's too generic (hard to trademark)
- Name conflicts with major brand (trademark litigation risk)
- Name that's hard to spell or pronounce
- Name that's embarrassing when said aloud

### Step 2: Appoint Registered Agent

**Requirement**: Every Delaware corporation must have registered agent with Delaware physical address (not P.O. box).

**Registered Agent Role**:
- Receive official state correspondence
- Receive legal service of process (lawsuits)
- Provide physical Delaware address for records
- Forward mail to you

**Options**:

**1. Professional Registered Agent Service** (Recommended)
- **Cost**: $50-300/year
- **Pros**: Reliable, professional, privacy (your address not public)
- **Cons**: Annual fee
- **Popular Services**:
  - Harvard Business Services ($50/year)
  - Incfile ($125/year)
  - Corporation Service Company (CSC) ($280/year)
  - VCorp Services ($150/year)

**2. Delaware Attorney**
- **Cost**: $200-500/year
- **Pros**: Attorney can also provide legal services
- **Cons**: Expensive, relationship-dependent
- **When to Use**: If you have Delaware attorney anyway

**3. Self/Founder** (NOT Recommended)
- **Cost**: $0
- **Pros**: Free
- **Cons**:
  - Must have Delaware physical address
  - Must be available during business hours
  - Your address becomes public record
  - Risk missing important legal documents
- **When to Use**: Only if you live in Delaware

**Recommendation**: Use Harvard Business Services ($50/year) for cost-effective professional service.

### Step 3: Prepare Certificate of Incorporation

**What It Is**: The founding document filed with Delaware that creates your corporation.

**Required Information**:
1. **Company Name**: Full legal name with Corp./Inc./etc.
2. **Registered Agent**: Name and Delaware address
3. **Purpose**: Can use broad language: "to engage in any lawful act or activity"
4. **Authorized Shares**: Total shares you CAN issue (not issued yet)
5. **Par Value**: Nominal value per share (typically $0.0001)
6. **Incorporator**: Person filing (can be anyone, doesn't need to be founder)

**Optional Provisions** (Recommended):
- Multiple stock classes (Common, Preferred)
- Director liability limitations
- Indemnification of directors/officers
- Anti-takeover provisions (staggered board, supermajority votes)

**Stock Structure Decisions**:

**Authorized Shares**:
- Typical: 10,000,000 - 20,000,000 shares
- Issue ~8,000,000 to founders initially
- Reserve room for option pool and future fundraising
- More shares = lower per-share price (easier for options)

**Stock Classes**:
- Initially: One class (Common Stock)
- Later: Add Preferred Stock when investors invest
- Amendment required to add stock classes later

**Par Value**:
- Recommended: $0.0001 per share
- Founders pay par value (pennies) for initial shares
- Keeps Delaware franchise tax low (Assumed Par Value method)
- Later investors pay fair market value

**Sample Certificate Structure**:
```
ARTICLE I: Name
The name of the corporation is [COMPANY NAME], Inc.

ARTICLE II: Registered Agent
The address of the registered office is [AGENT ADDRESS], and the name of the registered agent is [AGENT NAME].

ARTICLE III: Purpose

ARTICLE V: Incorporator
The name and mailing address of the incorporator is [NAME AND ADDRESS].

ARTICLE VI: Director Liability
No director shall be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

ARTICLE VII: Indemnification
The corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation.

```

**See Full Template**: `templates/board_resolution_template.md`

**Documentation**:
- Keep signed written consents in corporate minute book
- All directors/stockholders must sign
- Effective date is when last signature obtained

### Step 8: Issue Stock to Founders

**Process**:

**1. Execute Stock Purchase Agreements**
- Each founder signs agreement to purchase shares
- Includes vesting schedule (4-year/1-year cliff standard)
- Includes company right to repurchase unvested shares if founder leaves
- See template: `templates/stockholder_agreement_template.md`

**2. Collect Purchase Price**
- Founders pay par value (typically $0.0001/share = pennies total)
- Payment by cash, check, or services rendered
- Document payment in corporate records

**3. Issue Stock Certificates** (or use uncertificated shares)
- Physical certificates (traditional, requires stock certificate forms)
- Uncertificated shares (modern, no physical certificate)
- Most startups use cap table software (Carta, Pulley) - no physical certificates

**4. Record in Stock Ledger**
- Maintain accurate record of all stock issuances
- Required by law
- Typically managed in cap table software

**5. File 83(b) Elections** (CRITICAL!)
- MUST file within 30 days of stock grant
- Each founder files separately
- See detailed section below

**Stock Certificate Contents** (if using physical):
- Company name
- Stockholder name
- Number of shares
- Class of stock (Common Stock)
- Par value
- Issue date
- Signature of President and Secretary
- Corporate seal (optional)
- Legend noting transfer restrictions

**Cap Table Setup**:

After issuing founder stock, cap table looks like:

| Name | Shares | % | Vested | Unvested |
|------|--------|---|--------|----------|
| Founder 1 | 3,000,000 | 30% | 0 | 3,000,000 |
| Founder 2 | 3,000,000 | 30% | 0 | 3,000,000 |
| Founder 3 | 2,000,000 | 20% | 0 | 2,000,000 |
| Option Pool | 2,000,000 | 20% | - | - |
| **Total** | **10,000,000** | **100%** | **0** | **8,000,000** |

**Important**: All founder shares start unvested and vest over 4 years.

### Step 9: File 83(b) Elections (CRITICAL!)

**What Is 83(b) Election**:
IRS tax election to pay taxes on unvested stock NOW (when value is low) rather than as it vests (when value is high).

**Why It's Critical**:
Without 83(b), you pay ordinary income tax as stock vests based on CURRENT value. With 83(b), you pay tax once at grant based on GRANT value (pennies).

**Timeline**: MUST file within 30 days of stock grant date
- No extensions
- No exceptions
- Missing deadline = tax disaster

**How to File**:

**1. Complete 83(b) Election Form**
- Template: `templates/83b_election_template.md`
- Required info: Name, SSN, grant date, shares, purchase price, FMV

**2. Mail to IRS**
- Send certified mail with return receipt
- Keep tracking number as proof
- IRS address: Based on your state (see template)

**3. Include with Tax Return**
- Attach copy when filing next tax return
- Required documentation

**4. Provide to Company**
- Give copy to company for records
- Company files copy with records

**5. Keep Copy**
- Store your copy permanently
- Proof of filing if IRS questions

**Tax Calculation Example**:

**Without 83(b) Election**:
```
Year 1: 25% vests (2,000,000 shares)
Company valued at $10M → Your stock worth $2M
You owe income tax on $2M ordinary income = ~$800K in taxes
You have $0 cash (illiquid stock)
DISASTER - Can't pay taxes!

Year 2: Another 25% vests
Company valued at $50M → Your stock worth $10M
You owe income tax on $10M = ~$4M in taxes
BANKRUPTCY
```

**With 83(b) Election**:
```
Day 1: Pay tax on $8,000 value (8M shares × $0.001 par)
Tax owed: ~$3,200 (ordinary income)

Year 1-4: Stock vests
Tax owed: $0 (already paid)

Exit: Sell stock for $20M
Tax owed: ~$4M capital gains tax (20% rate)
Net proceeds: $16M

VS without 83(b): Would owe ~$8M in ordinary income taxes + capital gains
SAVINGS: ~$4M in taxes
```

**83(b) Checklist**:
- [ ] Complete 83(b) election form for each founder
- [ ] Sign and date
- [ ] Make 4 copies (IRS original, tax return, company, personal)

2. Forgetting foreign qualification in home state
3. Option pool too small (dilutes founders when increased)
4. Not using Qualified Small Business Stock structure (loses QSBS tax benefits)

**Minor Errors**:
1. Late Delaware annual report (small penalty)
