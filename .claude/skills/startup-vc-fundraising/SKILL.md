## Term Sheet Negotiation

### Understanding Term Sheets

**Key Sections**:

**1. Valuation and Investment**
- **Pre-money valuation**: Company value before investment
- **Post-money valuation**: Company value after investment
- **Investment amount**: Total dollars being invested
- **Price per share**: Investment amount ÷ new shares issued

**Example**:
- Pre-money valuation: $8M
- Investment amount: $2M
- Post-money valuation: $10M
- New investor ownership: 20%

**2. Liquidation Preference**
- **1x Non-Participating**: Investor gets 1x money back, then common shareholders share remaining (STANDARD)
- **1x Participating**: Investor gets 1x back, then participates in remaining with common (AVOID)
- **2x+**: Investor gets multiple of investment back (AVOID)

**Example Exit Scenarios** ($10M exit, $2M invested at $8M pre):
- 1x Non-Participating: Investor chooses $2M or 20% ($2M) = $2M
- 1x Participating: Investor gets $2M + 20% of $8M = $3.6M
- Common: Founders get $8M (non-participating) or $6.4M (participating)

**3. Anti-Dilution Protection**
- **Broad-based weighted average**: Adjusts price per share based on dilutive rounds (STANDARD)
- **Narrow-based weighted average**: More protective for investor
- **Full ratchet**: Reprices all shares to lowest price (AVOID)
- **No protection**: No adjustment (rare)

**4. Board Composition**
- **Common structure**: Founder(s), Investor(s), Independent(s)
- **Seed stage**: Often no board seats for seed investors
- **Series A**: Typically 1 VC board seat
- **Series B+**: May be 2 VC board seats
- **Board control**: Founders should maintain influence

**5. Voting Rights**
- **Protective provisions**: VC approval required for major decisions
- **Major decisions**: Liquidation, sale, dividends, new equity, debt
- **Board voting**: Typically majority approval required
- **Stockholder voting**: Varies by decision type

**6. Pro-Rata Rights**
- **Definition**: Right to invest in future rounds to maintain ownership %
- **Standard for lead investor**: Yes
- **Standard for others**: Often yes, with conditions
- **Super pro-rata**: Right to invest more than pro-rata share (negotiate carefully)

**7. Drag-Along Rights**
- **Definition**: Majority shareholders can force minority to sell in acquisition
- **Standard**: Yes, with conditions (minimum price, board approval)
- **Protection**: Ensure fair process and reasonable price threshold

**8. No-Shop Period**
- **Definition**: Exclusivity period where you can't solicit other investors
- **Typical duration**: 30-45 days
- **Reasonable**: 30 days
- **Watch out**: > 60 days (too long)

**9. Closing Conditions**
- **Due diligence completion**: Standard
- **Legal documentation**: Standard
- **Board/stockholder approval**: Standard
- **Other conditions**: Review carefully for deal-killers

### Negotiation Strategy

**Before Negotiating**:
- Consult with experienced startup lawyer
- Get multiple term sheets if possible
- Understand market standards
- Know your priorities (valuation vs. terms vs. partner fit)
- Prepare comparison spreadsheet

**Negotiation Priorities** (in order):
1. **Partner and firm fit**: Can't be changed later
2. **Board composition and control**: Critical for governance
3. **Liquidation preference**: 1x non-participating only
4. **Anti-dilution**: Broad-based weighted average
5. **Valuation**: Important but not everything
6. **Pro-rata rights**: Standard for lead investor
7. **Voting rights**: Reasonable protective provisions only

**Terms to Negotiate**:
- **Valuation**: Justify with comparables and metrics
- **Liquidation preference**: Push for 1x non-participating
- **Board seats**: Balance control with VC value-add
- **Protective provisions**: Limit to major events only
- **No-shop period**: Keep to 30 days if possible

**Terms to Accept** (market standard):
- Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution
- Pro-rata rights for lead investor
- Drag-along rights with reasonable conditions
- Standard vesting for new hires
- Standard protective provisions

**Red Flags** (push back hard):
- Multiple liquidation preference (2x+)
- Participating preferred
- Full ratchet anti-dilution
- Excessive board control
- Super voting rights
- Unreasonable no-shop (>60 days)
- Unusual closing conditions

**Negotiation Tactics**:
- Be prepared to walk away (have alternatives)
- Focus on win-win outcomes
- Don't over-negotiate minor points
- Be transparent about concerns
- Seek advice from experienced founders
- Remember: you're choosing a long-term partner

### Comparing Multiple Term Sheets

**Comparison Factors**:

**1. Economic Terms** (30% weight):
- Valuation (pre-money, post-money)
- Liquidation preference (type and multiple)
- Anti-dilution protection
- Option pool size and timing
- Founder dilution

**2. Control Terms** (30% weight):
- Board composition
- Voting rights and protective provisions
- Drag-along and tag-along rights
- Founder vesting terms
- Information rights

**3. Partner and Firm** (40% weight):
- Partner experience and expertise
- Firm reputation and brand
- Portfolio company references
- Network and value-add
- Follow-on capital availability
- Decision-making style

**Modeling Dilution**:
- Current ownership: 100%
- Series A: 20% dilution → 80% ownership
- Series B: 20% dilution → 64% ownership
- Series C: 15% dilution → 54.4% ownership
- Option pool dilution: Additional 10-15% per round

**Exit Scenario Analysis**:
Model different exit values ($10M, $50M, $100M, $500M) with each term sheet to see founder proceeds under various scenarios.

## Cap Table Management

### Understanding Equity

**Common Stock**:
- Issued to founders and employees
- Voting rights (1 vote per share)
- Last in liquidation preference
- Subject to vesting

**Preferred Stock**:
- Issued to investors
- Liquidation preference (1x typical)
- Conversion to common (1:1 typical)
- Protective provisions and voting rights
- Anti-dilution protection

**Options (Stock Options)**:
- Granted to employees
- Strike price (409A valuation)
- 4-year vesting (1-year cliff typical)
- 10-year exercise window (post-termination varies)
- Taxed as ordinary income on exercise

**RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)**:
- Common for later-stage companies
- No strike price or exercise
- 4-year vesting typical
- Taxed as ordinary income when vested

### Cap Table Structure

**Pre-Seed Stage**:
```
Founders: 90-95%
Advisor equity: 0.25-1% each (3-5 advisors)
Option pool: 10%
Total: 100%
```

**Seed Stage** (after $2M raise at $8M pre):
```
Founders: 72% (90% * 80%)
Advisors: 0.8% (1% * 80%)
Employees (options): 7.2% (9% * 80%)
Seed investors: 20%
Option pool (remaining): 0% (refreshed to 10%)
Total: 100%
```

**Series A** (after $10M raise at $30M pre):
```
Founders: 54% (72% * 75%)
Advisors: 0.6% (0.8% * 75%)
Employees (options): 9.4% (5.4% from seed + 4% from new pool)
Seed investors: 15% (20% * 75%)
Series A investors: 25%
Option pool (remaining): 6%
Total: 100%
```

### Dilution Dynamics

**Sources of Dilution**:
1. **Investment rounds**: New shares issued to investors
2. **Option pool increases**: New shares reserved for employees
3. **Advisor equity**: Shares or options for advisors
4. **Warrants**: Rarely used, but can dilute

**Typical Dilution Per Round**:
- **Seed**: 15-25% dilution
- **Series A**: 20-30% dilution
- **Series B**: 15-25% dilution
- **Series C+**: 10-20% dilution

**Founder Ownership Over Time**:
- **At founding**: 100% (split among co-founders)
- **After seed**: 70-80%
- **After Series A**: 50-60%
- **After Series B**: 35-50%
- **After Series C+**: 25-40%
- **At IPO/exit**: 15-30% (for successful companies)

**Dilution Calculator**:
```
New ownership % = Old ownership % * (1 - Investment % / (100% + Option pool increase %))

Example:
- Current ownership: 80%
- Investment: 20% of post-money
- Option pool increase: 10% of post-money

New ownership = 80% * (1 - 20% / (100% + 10%))
New ownership = 80% * (1 - 20% / 110%)
New ownership = 80% * (1 - 18.2%)
New ownership = 80% * 81.8%
New ownership = 65.4%
```

### Option Pool Strategy

**Option Pool Size**:
- **Pre-seed**: 10-15% of fully diluted
- **Seed**: 10-15% (refreshed if depleted)
- **Series A**: 10-15% (refreshed)
- **Series B+**: 8-12% (refreshed)

**Pool Timing**:
- **Pre-money pool**: Created before investment (investor-friendly)
- **Post-money pool**: Created after investment (founder-friendly)

**Example** ($2M investment at $8M pre):

Pre-money pool (investor-friendly):
- $8M pre-money includes 10% option pool
- Founders: $7.2M (72%)
- Option pool: $0.8M (8%)
- Total pre-money: $8M
- Investment: $2M (20% of post)
- Post-money: $10M
- Founders: 72%, Investors: 20%, Options: 8%

Post-money pool (founder-friendly):
- $8M pre-money is 80% of post-money
- Investment: $2M (20% of post)
- Post-money: $10M
- 10% option pool created post-money
- Founders: 72%, Investors: 20%, Options: 10%

**Negotiating Pool Size**:
- VCs may push for large pre-money pool
- Justify smaller pool with hiring plan
- Consider post-money pool if possible
- Refresh pool as needed, not preemptively

## Fundraising Mistakes to Avoid

### Strategic Mistakes

**1. Raising Too Early**
- Problem: Weak traction, unclear product-market fit
- Impact: Lower valuation, harder to raise
- Solution: Wait until key milestones hit

**2. Raising Too Much**
- Problem: High valuation pressure, dilution concerns
- Impact: Down round risk, lost focus
- Solution: Raise for 18-24 months, not 36+

**3. Raising Too Little**
- Problem: Not enough runway to hit milestones
- Impact: Emergency fundraising, desperation
- Solution: Plan for 18-24 month runway minimum

**4. Wrong Investors**
- Problem: Misaligned values, unhelpful investors
- Impact: Board dysfunction, strategic misalignment
- Solution: Do reference checks, prioritize fit

**5. Ignoring Terms**

- Impact: Weak negotiating position
- Solution: Build investor pipeline, multiple conversations
