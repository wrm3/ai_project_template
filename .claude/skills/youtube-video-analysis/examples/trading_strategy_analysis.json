  "transcription": "In this video, I'm going to explain the RSI divergence trading strategy. This is a momentum reversal strategy that works particularly well in ranging markets. The key is to look for divergence between price action and the RSI indicator. When price makes a lower low but RSI makes a higher low, that's bullish divergence...",

    "strategy_name": "RSI Divergence Strategy",
    "summary": "The RSI Divergence Strategy is a momentum reversal trading approach that identifies potential trend reversals by spotting divergences between price action and the RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicator. The strategy works best in ranging or choppy markets where price is making new highs or lows but momentum is weakening. Traders enter positions when divergence is confirmed with additional signals like volume or candlestick patterns.",
