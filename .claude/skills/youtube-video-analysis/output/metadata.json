  "description": "Claude Agent Skills? What about MCP? Subagents? Slash Commands?  Let's break down EXACTLY when to use agent skills vs MCP servers vs sub-agents vs custom slash commands.\n\n🔥 Here's the truth: Claude Code has evolved from a simple tool into a BEAST with agent skills, sub-agents, custom slash commands, output styles, plugins, hooks, and MCP servers. It's getting confusing AF.\n\nAfter a WEEK of wrestling with agent skill issues, I'm breaking down the RIGHT way and the WRONG way to use these features so you don't waste time like I did.\n\n🎥 VIDEO REFERENCES\n\n- Claude Code Skills: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills\n\n- Multi-Agent Observability Codebase (get the meta-skill): https://github.com/disler/claude-code-hooks-multi-agent-observability\n\n- Tactical Agentic Coding: https://agenticengineer.com/tactical-agentic-coding?y=kFpLzCVLA20\n\nIn this video, I'm walking you through the REAL differences between agent skills, MCP servers, sub-agents, and custom slash commands. We'll dive deep into agentic coding patterns, showing you exactly when to use each Claude Code feature and why it matters for your AI coding workflow.\n\nI'll show you the wrong way engineers are approaching agent skills (converting ALL slash commands to skills - BIG MISTAKE), and then reveal the right compositional approach that leverages prompt engineering as your foundation.\n\nWatch as I build a Git worktree manager skill live, demonstrating how to properly compose custom slash commands, sub-agents, and MCP servers into a powerful reusable agent skill. This is tactical agentic coding at its finest.\n\nWhether you're deep into agentic engineering or just getting started with Claude Code and indydevdan's approach to AI agents, this breakdown will save you HOURS of confusion and help you master the core four: context, model, prompt, and tools.\n\nThe prompt is STILL the fundamental unit of knowledge work. Don't give it away to complex abstractions. Skills are powerful, but they're compositional units - NOT replacements for your custom slash commands and prompt engineering fundamentals.\n\nWe'll cover:\n- When agent skills shine vs when they're overkill\n- Why prompt engineering remains your most critical skill\n- How to compose features without circular confusion\n- Real production patterns for agentic coding workflows\n- The pros and cons of Claude Code's agent skills feature\n\nThis is essential viewing for any AI coding engineer who wants to stay ahead in agentic engineering. Stop the confusion. Master the features. Ship better code.\n\nStay focused and keep building.\n\n#aicoding #claudecode #aiagents",
