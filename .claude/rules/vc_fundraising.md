# VC Fundraising Best Practices

Best practices and rules for venture capital fundraising from pre-seed through Series A+.

## Core Principles

### 1. Preparation is Everything
- Start preparing 3-6 months before active fundraising
- Build comprehensive data room in advance
- Practice pitch 10+ times before first VC meeting
- Research every VC before outreach
- Have 6-9 months runway when starting fundraise

### 2. Storytelling Over Features
- Lead with problem, not solution
- Quantify pain points and market opportunity
- Show traction and momentum
- Connect metrics to story
- End with inspiring vision

### 3. Metrics Drive Decisions
- Know your key metrics cold
- Compare against industry benchmarks
- Show consistent growth trajectory
- Be honest about challenges
- Demonstrate path to next stage

### 4. Terms Matter More Than Valuation
- 1x non-participating liquidation preference (gold standard)
- Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution
- Reasonable board composition
- Limited protective provisions
- Avoid participating preferred and full ratchet

### 5. Choose Partners, Not Just Money
- Reference check VCs with portfolio founders
- Assess value-add beyond capital
- Evaluate decision-making style and speed
- Consider long-term partnership fit
- Prioritize helpful, transparent investors

## Pitch Deck Rules

### Content Requirements
- **15 slides maximum** (main deck)
- **One key message per slide**
- **Bullets, not paragraphs** (3-5 bullets max)
- **Quantify everything** (metrics, market size, impact)
- **Current data** (< 1 month old)
- **Traction over potential** (show, don't just tell)

### Slide Requirements

**Must Have**:
1. Cover (logo, tagline, contact)
2. Problem (clear, painful, quantified)
3. Solution (10x better, not 10%)
4. Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM with bottom-up)
5. Product (screenshots, demo)
6. Business Model (pricing, unit economics)
7. Traction (metrics, growth, customers)
8. Competition (2x2 matrix or table)
9. Competitive Advantage (moat)
10. Go-to-Market (channels, strategy)
11. Team (founders + key hires)
12. Financials (historical + projections)
13. Fundraising Ask (amount, use of funds, milestones)
14. Vision (long-term opportunity)
15. Thank You (contact, next steps)

**Appendix** (5-10 backup slides):
- Detailed financials
- Customer case studies
- Product roadmap
- Extended team bios
- Market research

### Design Rules
- Clean, professional design
- Consistent fonts (2-3 max) and colors
- High-resolution images (300 DPI+)
- Plenty of white space
- Large, readable font (24pt+ body text)
- High contrast (dark on light)

### Distribution Rules
- **PDF format** for email (password-protected)
- **PowerPoint/Keynote** for presenting
- **DocSend** for tracking analytics
- **Naming**: CompanyName_PitchDeck_Stage_Date.pdf
- **Password**: Simple (e.g., CompanySeed2025)
- **Version control**: Date every version

## VC Research and Outreach Rules

### Building Target List
- **100+ VCs minimum** for seed round
- **Filter by**: Stage, check size, industry, geography, thesis
- **Prioritize into tiers**: Tier 1 (perfect fit), Tier 2 (good), Tier 3 (possible), Tier 4 (stretch)
- **Research each VC**: Portfolio, recent investments, partner backgrounds, thesis

### Warm Introductions (Always Priority #1)
- **Leverage**: Portfolio founders, mutual investors, advisors, accelerators
- **Process**: Ask permission → provide intro blurb → thank connector
- **Success rate**: 30-50% meeting rate (vs. 5-10% cold)

### Cold Outreach
- **Personalize every email** (mention portfolio, thesis, recent investment)
- **Keep it short** (5-7 sentences max)
- **Lead with traction** or unique insight
- **Explain VC fit** specifically (not generic)
- **Clear CTA**: "Would you be open to a 15-min call?"
- **Follow-up cadence**: Day 4-5, Day 10-12, Day 20-25 (3 emails max)

### Email Subject Lines
- **Good**: "[Mutual Connection] intro - [Company]"
- **Good**: "[Company] - AI-powered revenue intelligence (Seed)"
- **Bad**: "Seeking investment"
- **Bad**: "Quick question"

## Meeting and Pitching Rules

### Before Meeting

- **Prepare questions**: 2-3 thoughtful questions for VC
- **Arrive early**: 5 minutes (in-person or Zoom)

### During Meeting

- **Start with problem** (hook them immediately)
- **Show, don't just tell** (product demo, metrics)
- **Listen carefully** to questions and concerns

### Common Investor Questions (Be Prepared)

## Term Sheet Negotiation Rules

### Before Negotiating
- **Get multiple term sheets** if possible (leverage)
- **Consult startup lawyer** (worth the cost)
- **Understand market standards** (don't accept bad terms)
- **Prioritize terms** (partnership > control > economics > valuation)

### Negotiation Priorities (In Order)

**Priority 1 (Critical)**:
- **Partner and firm fit**: Can't change later (check references!)
- **Liquidation preference**: 1x non-participating ONLY
- **Board composition**: Balance control with value-add
- **Anti-dilution**: Broad-based weighted average (avoid full ratchet)

**Priority 2 (Important)**:
- **Protective provisions**: Limit to major events only
- **Valuation**: Fair market value (don't overprice)
- **Pro-rata rights**: Standard for lead investor
- **No-shop period**: 30 days preferred (45 max)

**Priority 3 (Nice-to-Have)**:
- **Option pool**: Post-money preferred (less founder dilution)
- **Drag-along rights**: Reasonable (minimum price, board approval)
- **Information rights**: Standard reporting (not excessive)

### Terms to Accept (Market Standard)
✅ 1x non-participating liquidation preference
✅ Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution
✅ Pro-rata rights for lead investor
✅ Standard protective provisions (sale, new equity, debt, dividends)
✅ Drag-along with reasonable conditions
✅ 30-45 day no-shop period

### Red Flags (Negotiate Hard or Walk Away)
🚩 Participating preferred (2x money in exits)
🚩 Multiple liquidation preference (2x, 3x, etc.)
🚩 Full ratchet anti-dilution (punitive to founders)
🚩 Excessive board control (investor dominates)
🚩 Super voting rights (investor vetoes)
🚩 Unreasonable no-shop (> 60 days)
🚩 Unusual closing conditions (deal-killers)

### Negotiation Tactics
- **Be prepared to walk away** (have alternatives)
- **Focus on win-win** (long-term partnership)
- **Don't over-negotiate** minor points (pick battles)
- **Be transparent** about concerns
- **Seek founder advice** (those who've been there)
- **Remember**: You're choosing a partner for 5-10 years

## Due Diligence Rules

### Data Room Organization
Create folders with clear structure:
- Company Overview (formation docs, cap table, board resolutions)
- Financials (P&L, balance sheet, projections, revenue detail)
- Contracts (customers, vendors, partners, leases)
- IP (patents, trademarks, licenses, assignments)
- Legal (litigation, compliance, insurance, tax)
- Product (docs, architecture, roadmap, metrics)
- Sales & Marketing (pipeline, materials, strategy)
- HR (org chart, compensation, employee agreements)

### Response Time Rules
- **Urgent requests** (contracts, financials): 24 hours
- **Standard requests** (additional docs): 24-48 hours
- **Complex requests** (analysis, modeling): 2-3 days
- **Always acknowledge**: Email receipt within 4 hours

### Transparency Rules
- **Be honest** about challenges and concerns
- **Provide context** for any red flags
- **Don't hide** issues (they'll find out eventually)
- **Explain** changes or anomalies in data
- **Proactively address** potential concerns

### Customer Reference Rules
- **Select 3-5 diverse customers**: Different sizes, industries, use cases
- **Prepare references**: Brief on VC, provide talking points
- **Key topics**: Why they chose you, implementation experience, results/ROI, product feedback, future plans
- **Thank them**: Always follow up with gratitude

### Momentum Maintenance
- **Weekly updates** to VC (even if no progress)
- **Proactive communication** on delays or issues
- **Keep process moving** (don't let stall)
- **Escalate** if VC is slow (talk to partner)
- **Set deadlines** for closing (create urgency)

## Cap Table and Dilution Rules

### Option Pool Sizing
- **Pre-seed**: 10-15% of fully diluted
- **Seed**: 10-15% (refresh if depleted)
- **Series A**: 10-15% (refresh)
- **Series B+**: 8-12% (refresh)

### Pool Timing Strategy
- **Pre-money pool**: Investor-friendly (dilutes founders before investment)
- **Post-money pool**: Founder-friendly (dilutes everyone including investor)
- **Negotiate**: Push for post-money or smaller pre-money pool

### Dilution Expectations
- **Seed round**: 15-25% dilution
- **Series A**: 20-30% dilution
- **Series B**: 15-25% dilution
- **Series C+**: 10-20% dilution

### Founder Ownership Over Time
- **After seed**: 70-80%
- **After Series A**: 50-60%
- **After Series B**: 35-50%
- **After Series C+**: 25-40%
- **At IPO/exit**: 15-30% (if successful)

### Modeling Dilution
Always model these scenarios:
- Current ownership breakdown
- Post-round ownership (with option pool)
- Next round dilution (assume 20-25%)
- Exit scenarios ($25M, $50M, $100M, $250M, $500M)
- Founder proceeds in each scenario

### Cap Table Tools
- **Early stage (free)**: Google Sheets, Carta free tier
- **Growth stage (paid)**: Carta ($1,200-$6,000/year), Pulley ($500-$2,000/year)
- **Features needed**: Modeling, 409A valuations, employee equity management, investor reporting

## Stage-Specific Metrics

✅ 15-30% MoM growth
✅ 100-1,000 paying customers
✅ Product-market fit signals (low churn, high engagement, NPS > 40)
✅ Repeatable sales process emerging

### Series A
✅ $1M+ ARR
✅ 10-20% MoM growth (or 100%+ YoY)
✅ 500-5,000 customers
✅ LTV/CAC > 3x, < 12 month payback
✅ 90%+ gross revenue retention
✅ 110%+ net revenue retention

### Series B
✅ $10M+ ARR
✅ 100%+ YoY growth
✅ LTV/CAC > 5x, 6-9 month payback
✅ 75-85% gross margins (SaaS)
✅ 120-130%+ net revenue retention
✅ Rule of 40 (Growth% + Profit% > 40)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Strategic Mistakes

❌ No alternatives (single term sheet)
❌ Taking too long (> 6 months)

### Pitch Mistakes
❌ Too much text (use bullets, not paragraphs)

❌ Unrealistic projections (10x growth with no basis)
❌ Weak team (missing key roles)

❌ No clear ask (missing amount or terms)

### Negotiation Mistakes
❌ Over-negotiating (fighting every term)
❌ Under-negotiating (accepting bad terms)
❌ Valuation obsession (ignoring terms)
❌ No lawyer (trying to DIY)
❌ Playing investors against each other (burns bridges)
❌ Rushing (pressure to close quickly)

### Due Diligence Mistakes
