   - **Technical Considerations**: Affected subsystems, dependencies, integration points
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: How we know it's done
   - **Priority**: Critical, high, medium, or low

2. **Create Feature Document**: I'll generate:
   - Feature file in `.fstrent_spec_tasks/features/`
   - Complete feature specification
   - User stories with acceptance criteria
   - Technical requirements
   - Testing strategy
   - Related tasks section

3. **Update PLAN.md**: I'll add:
   - Feature to core features section
   - Priority indication

   - Update affected sections

4. **Create Initial Tasks**: I'll optionally:
   - Break feature into implementation tasks
   - Create task files
   - Update TASKS.md
   - Set up dependencies
